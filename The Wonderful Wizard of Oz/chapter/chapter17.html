    <p data-start="14.08" data-end="15.22" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十七章： 氣球是如何發射的</p>
  
    <p data-start="16.32" data-end="56.08">For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs.</p>
    <p data-start="16.32" data-end="56.08">連續三天桃樂絲都沒有收到奧茲的消息。這對小女孩來說是悲傷的日子，雖然她的朋友們都很快樂和滿足。稻草人告訴他們，他的腦子裡有很多奇妙的想法；但他不會說出來，因為他知道除了他自己，沒有人能理解它們。當錫樵夫走動時，他感覺他的心在胸中咯咯作響；他告訴桃樂絲，他發現這是一顆比他用肉體時擁有的心更善良和溫柔的心。獅子宣稱他不再害怕地球上的任何東西，並且會很樂意面對一支軍隊或十幾隻凶猛的卡利達。</p>
  
    <p data-start="57.90" data-end="81.48">Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas. On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly: "Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country." "And back to Kansas?" she asked eagerly.</p>
    <p data-start="57.90" data-end="81.48">於是小團隊中的每個人都很滿足，除了桃樂絲，她比以往任何時候都更渴望回到堪薩斯。第四天，令她非常高興的是，奧茲派人來找她，當她進入寶座室時，他愉快地迎接她：「坐下，我親愛的；我想我找到了讓你離開這個國家的方法。」 「回到堪薩斯？」她急切地問。</p>
  
    <p data-start="82.28" data-end="97.24">"Well, I'm not sure about Kansas," said Oz, "for I haven't the faintest notion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home." "How can I cross the desert?" she inquired.</p>
    <p data-start="82.28" data-end="97.24">「嗯，我不確定是否是堪薩斯。」奧茲說，「因為我根本不知道它在哪個方向。但是首先要做的是穿越沙漠，然後應該很容易找到回家的路。」 「我怎麼能穿越沙漠？」她問道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="97.76" data-end="127.70">"Well, I'll tell you what I think," said the little man. "You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I believe I can make a balloon." "How?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="97.76" data-end="127.70">「嗯，我告訴你我的想法。」小個子男人說。「你看，當我來到這個國家時，是坐著氣球來的。你也是通過空中，被龍捲風帶過來的。所以我相信穿越沙漠的最好方法是通過空中。現在，製造一個龍捲風超出了我的能力範圍；但我一直在思考這個問題，我相信我可以製造一個氣球。」 「怎麼製造？」桃樂絲問道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="127.76" data-end="154.84">"A balloon," said Oz, "is made of silk, which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be no trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with, to make it float." "If it won't float," remarked Dorothy, "it will be of no use to us." "True," answered Oz. "But there is another way to make it float, which is to fill it with hot air.</p>
    <p data-start="127.76" data-end="154.84">「氣球，」奧茲說，「是用絲綢製成的，上面塗了一層膠水以保持氣體。我在宮殿裡有很多絲綢，所以製作氣球不成問題。但是在這個國家，沒有氣體可以填充氣球，使其漂浮起來。」 「如果它不會漂浮，」桃樂絲說，「那對我們沒有任何用處。」 「沒錯，」奧茲回答。「但還有另一種使它漂浮的方法，就是填充熱空氣。</p>
  
    <p data-start="155.88" data-end="181.84">Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we should be lost." "We!" exclaimed the girl. "Are you going with me?" "Yes, of course," replied Oz. "I am tired of being such a humbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.</p>
    <p data-start="155.88" data-end="181.84">熱空氣不如氣體好，因為如果空氣變冷，氣球會降落在沙漠中，我們會迷路。」 「我們！」女孩驚呼道。「你要和我一起去嗎？」 「是的，當然，」奧茲回答。「我厭倦了當一個騙子。如果我走出這個宮殿，我的人民很快就會發現我不是巫師，然後他們會因為我欺騙了他們而惱火。</p>
  
    <p data-start="182.56" data-end="195.82">So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again." "I shall be glad to have your company," said Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="182.56" data-end="195.82">所以我得整天呆在這些房間裡，這讓人很厭煩。我更願意和你一起回到堪薩斯，再次參加馬戲團。」 「有你的陪伴我會很高興的。」桃樂絲說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="196.98" data-end="203.22">"Thank you," he answered. "Now, if you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon."</p>
    <p data-start="196.98" data-end="203.22">「謝謝你，」他回答。「現在，如果你幫我把絲綢縫在一起，我們就可以開始製作氣球了。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="203.22" data-end="270.00">So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long. Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready. "But we must have a basket to ride in," he said. So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon. When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds.</p>
    <p data-start="203.22" data-end="270.00">於是桃樂絲拿起針線，當奧茲快速將絲綢切成合適的形狀時，女孩將它們整齊地縫在一起。首先是一條淺綠色的絲綢，然後是一條深綠色的絲綢，接著是一條翠綠色的絲綢；因為奧茲喜歡把氣球做成不同色調。縫合所有條紋花了三天的時間，但完成後，他們有了一個超過二十英尺長的綠色絲綢袋。然後奧茲在內部塗上一層薄薄的膠水，使其氣密，之後他宣布氣球已經準備好了。「但是我們必須有一個籃子來乘坐，」他說。於是他派綠鬍子的士兵去拿一個大衣籃，並用很多繩子將其固定在氣球的底部。當一切準備就緒後，奧茲告訴他的人民，他要去拜訪住在雲中的偉大巫師兄弟。</p>
  
    <p data-start="270.56" data-end="293.14">The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight. Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag.</p>
    <p data-start="270.56" data-end="293.14">這個消息迅速傳遍全城，每個人都來看這奇妙的景象。奧茲命令將氣球帶到宮殿前面，人們好奇地注視著它。錫樵夫砍了一大堆木頭，現在他用它生火，而奧茲把氣球的底部放在火上，讓從火中升起的熱空氣被捕捉到絲綢袋中。</p>
  
    <p data-start="294.16" data-end="329.06">Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the ground. Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice: "I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me." The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.</p>
    <p data-start="294.16" data-end="329.06">逐漸地，氣球膨脹起來並升上天空，直到最後籃子剛好觸地。然後奧茲進入籃子，大聲對所有人說：「我現在要去拜訪。當我不在的時候，稻草人將統治你們。我命令你們像服從我一樣服從他。」這時，氣球正在用力拉著固定在地上的繩子，因為裡面的空氣是熱的，這使得它比外面的空氣輕得多，以至於它用力拉升到天空。</p>
  
    <p data-start="330.02" data-end="334.38">"Come, Dorothy!" cried the Wizard. "Hurry up, or the balloon will fly away."</p>
    <p data-start="330.02" data-end="334.38">「快來，桃樂絲！」巫師喊道。「快點，否則氣球會飛走的。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="335.12" data-end="350.44">"I can't find Toto anywhere," replied Dorothy, who did not wish to leave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran towards the balloon.</p>
    <p data-start="335.12" data-end="350.44">「我哪裡都找不到托托。」桃樂絲回答道，她不願意把她的小狗留下。托托跑進人群中對著一隻小貓叫，桃樂絲終於找到了他。她抱起他，朝氣球跑去。</p>
  
    <p data-start="350.86" data-end="403.22">She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her. "Come back!" she screamed. "I want to go, too!" "I can't come back, my dear," called Oz from the basket. "Good-bye!" "Good-bye!" shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and farther into the sky. And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know. But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another: "Oz was always our friend.</p>
    <p data-start="350.86" data-end="403.22">她離氣球只有幾步之遙，奧茲伸出雙手想幫她進入籃子，這時，啪！繩子斷了，氣球在她沒有上去的情況下升空了。「回來！」她尖叫道。「我也想去！」 「我不能回來，我親愛的。」奧茲從籃子裡喊道。「再見！」 「再見！」每個人都喊著，所有人的目光都向上望去，巫師乘坐的籃子每時每刻都在升向更高的天空。那是他們最後一次看到奧茲，這位奇妙的巫師，儘管我們知道他可能已經安全到達奧馬哈，現在就在那裡。但是人們深情地記住了他，互相說道：「奧茲一直是我們的朋友。</p>
  
    <p data-start="403.54" data-end="419.32">When he was here he built for us this beautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us." Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, and would not be comforted.</p>
    <p data-start="403.54" data-end="419.32">當他在這裡時，他為我們建造了這座美麗的翡翠城，現在他走了，他留下了聰明的稻草人來統治我們。」儘管如此，許多天來，他們仍為失去這位奇妙的巫師而悲傷，無法得到安慰。</p>
