    <p data-start="14.08" data-end="15.42" style="margin-left: 35%;">第20章：精緻的瓷器國度</p>
    <p data-start="16.80" data-end="33.18">While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk. The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him. The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:</p>
    <p data-start="16.80" data-end="33.18">當樵夫在森林中找到木材製作梯子時，桃樂絲因長途跋涉而感到疲憊，便躺下睡覺。獅子也蜷縮起來睡覺，小狗托托則躺在它身邊。稻草人看著樵夫工作，對他說：</p>
    <p data-start="33.78" data-end="46.62">"I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of." "Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall," replied the Woodman. "When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the other side."</p>
    <p data-start="33.78" data-end="46.62">「我無法理解為什麼這牆會在這裡，也不明白它是由什麼材料製成的。」樵夫回答說：「別再費神去想這牆了，我們爬過去後，就會知道另一邊是什麼了。」</p>
    <p data-start="47.80" data-end="78.32">After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said, "Oh, my!" "Go on," exclaimed Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="47.80" data-end="78.32">不久，梯子完成了。它看起來笨拙，但鐵皮樵夫確信它很結實，能夠達到他們的目的。稻草人叫醒了桃樂絲、獅子和托托，告訴他們梯子已經準備好了。稻草人首先爬上梯子，但他動作笨拙，桃樂絲不得不緊跟在後，防止他掉下來。當稻草人把頭探過牆頂時，他說：“哦，我的天！”桃樂絲驚呼：“繼續往上爬。”</p>
    <p data-start="79.26" data-end="90.50">So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, "Oh, my!" just as the Scarecrow had done.</p>
    <p data-start="79.26" data-end="90.50">於是，稻草人爬得更高，坐在了牆頂上，桃樂絲也把頭伸過去，像稻草人一樣驚呼：“哦，我的天！”</p>
    <p data-start="91.44" data-end="106.30">Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him be still. The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both of them cried, "Oh, my!" as soon as they looked over the wall.</p>
    <p data-start="91.44" data-end="106.30">接著，托托也爬了上來，立刻開始叫起來，但桃樂絲讓他安靜下來。獅子接著爬上梯子，鐵皮樵夫最後才上來，但他們看到牆的另一邊時，都驚呼：“哦，我的天！”</p>
    <p data-start="107.32" data-end="122.06">When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw a strange sight. Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter.</p>
    <p data-start="107.32" data-end="122.06">當他們都坐在牆頂排成一排時，他們往下看，看到了一個奇特的景象。面前是一片廣闊的土地，地面平滑、閃亮，白得像大盤子的底部。</p>
    <p data-start="123.08" data-end="135.22">Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors. These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy's waist.</p>
    <p data-start="123.08" data-end="135.22">四周散落著許多完全由瓷器製成的房屋，塗有最亮眼的顏色。這些房屋都很小，最大的也只有桃樂絲腰部那麼高。</p>
    <p data-start="136.02" data-end="147.56">There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.</p>
    <p data-start="136.02" data-end="147.56">還有一些漂亮的小穀倉，周圍圍著瓷器製成的圍欄；許多瓷器製成的牛、羊、馬、豬和雞聚在一塊。</p>
    <p data-start="148.96" data-end="165.58">But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple;</p>
    <p data-start="148.96" data-end="165.58">但最奇特的還是生活在這個古怪國度的人們。這裡有穿著鮮豔胸衣和金色斑點裙子的乳牛女，還有穿著銀色、金色和紫色華麗禮服的公主；</p>
    <p data-start="166.24" data-end="195.62">and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps.</p>
    <p data-start="166.24" data-end="195.62">牧羊人穿著及膝馬褲，上面有粉紅色、黃色和藍色的條紋，鞋子上有金色的扣環。王子們頭戴寶石王冠，穿著貂皮長袍和綢緞上衣；還有穿著荷葉邊長袍、臉頰上有圓形紅斑、戴著又高又尖的帽子的滑稽小丑。</p>
    <p data-start="195.68" data-end="217.66">And, strangest of all, these people were all made of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy's knee. No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again. "How shall we get down?" asked Dorothy. They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again. "We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,"</p>
    <p data-start="195.68" data-end="217.66">最奇怪的是，這些人全都是瓷器製成的，連衣服也不例外，他們都非常矮小，最高的也只有桃樂絲的膝蓋高。最初沒有人理會旅行者，除了那隻頭特別大的紫色瓷器狗，它跑到牆邊，用小聲的嗓音對他們吠叫，然後又跑了回去。“我們怎麼下去？”桃樂絲問。他們發現梯子太重了，拉不動，所以稻草人從牆上摔了下來，其他人跳下來落在他身上，以免硬地板傷到他們的腳。當然，他們小心翼翼地避免落在他的頭上，以免把針扎進腳裡。當大家安全落地後，他們扶起了稻草人，他的身體被壓得扁平了，重新把他的稻草拍回原狀。“我們必須穿越這個奇怪的地方才能到達另一邊，”</p>
    <p data-start="247.68" data-end="284.86">said Dorothy, "for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South." They began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter. Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.</p>
    <p data-start="247.68" data-end="284.86">桃樂絲說，“因為除了往正南方走，其他路徑都不明智。”他們開始在瓷器國度中行走，首先遇到的是一位正在擠奶的瓷器乳牛女。當他們靠近時，牛突然踢了一腳，把凳子、桶，甚至乳牛女自己都踢翻了，所有東西都砰然落在瓷器地上。桃樂絲驚訝地看到牛的腿斷了，桶散落成幾片，而可憐的乳牛女左手肘也有了刮痕。</p>
    <p data-start="285.60" data-end="294.30">"There!" cried the milkmaid angrily. "See what you have done! My cow has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have it glued on again.</p>
    <p data-start="285.60" data-end="294.30">“看哪！”乳牛女憤怒地喊道。“看看你們做了什麼！我的牛腿斷了，我得把它送到修補店去重新粘合。”</p>
    <p data-start="294.76" data-end="301.26">What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow?" "I'm very sorry," returned Dorothy. "Please forgive us."</p>
    <p data-start="294.76" data-end="301.26">“你們為什麼來這裡嚇到我的牛？”“非常抱歉，”桃樂絲回答。“請原諒我們。”</p>
    <p data-start="301.72" data-end="322.74">But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.</p>
    <p data-start="301.72" data-end="322.74">但漂亮的乳牛女對他們感到非常生氣，沒有做出任何回應。她生氣地拾起牛腿，領著牛離開了，可憐的動物一瘸一拐地走著。她離開時，乳牛女回頭多次投來譴責的目光，將受傷的手肘緊貼在身旁。</p>
    <p data-start="323.62" data-end="333.70">Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap. "We must be very careful here," said the kind-hearted Woodman, "or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it."</p>
    <p data-start="323.62" data-end="333.70">桃樂絲對這次意外感到非常難過。“我們在這裡必須非常小心，”善良的樵夫說，“不然我們可能會傷害這些漂亮的小人們，讓他們永遠無法康復。”</p>
    <p data-start="334.20" data-end="343.50">A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away.</p>
    <p data-start="334.20" data-end="343.50">再往前走一點，桃樂絲遇到了一位穿著最漂亮的年輕公主，當她看到陌生人時停了下來並開始逃跑。</p>
    <p data-start="344.72" data-end="349.52">Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But the china girl cried out:</p>
    <p data-start="344.72" data-end="349.52">桃樂絲想多看看公主，所以她跑去追。但瓷器女孩驚恐地喊道：</p>
    <p data-start="349.84" data-end="379.72">"Don't chase me! Don't chase me!" She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said, "Why not?" "Because," answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away, "if I run I may fall down and break myself." "But could you not be mended?" asked the girl. "Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know," replied the Princess. "I suppose not," said Dorothy. "Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,"</p>
    <p data-start="349.84" data-end="379.72">“別追我！別追我！”她的聲音如此驚慌，桃樂絲停下來問：“為什麼不呢？”“因為，”公主回答說，也停在安全的距離外，“如果我跑的話，可能會摔倒並摔壞自己。”“那你不能修補嗎？”女孩問。“哦，當然可以；但修補後總是不如原來那麼漂亮，你知道的，”公主回答。“我想也是，”桃樂絲說。““這位是小丑先生，我們的小丑之一，”，”</p>
    <p data-start="379.74" data-end="393.04">continued the china lady, "who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all pretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself."</p>
    <p data-start="379.74" data-end="393.04">瓷器公主繼續說，“他總是試圖站在頭上。他已經摔壞了很多次，身上有上百處修補痕跡，看上去一點也不漂亮。看，他現在來了，你可以自己看看。”</p>
    <p data-start="393.30" data-end="421.08">Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places. The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:</p>
    <p data-start="393.30" data-end="421.08">的確，一個愉快的小丑朝他們走來，桃樂絲看到儘管他穿著紅色、黃色和綠色的漂亮衣服，但全身都布滿了裂縫，明顯地顯示出他曾經被修補過多處。小丑把手插在口袋裡，鼓起腮幫子，調皮地向他們點頭，然後說：</p>
    <p data-start="421.08" data-end="429.78">"My lady fair, Why do you stare At poor old Mr. Joker? You're quite as stiff And prim as if You'd eaten up a poker!" "Be quiet, sir!" said the Princess.</p>
    <p data-start="421.08" data-end="429.78">“我的美麗小姐，你為什麼盯著可憐的老小丑？你看起來既僵硬又古板，好像吞下了個火鈸！”“安靜，先生！”公主說。</p>
    <p data-start="430.16" data-end="438.36">"Can't you see these are strangers, and should be treated with respect?" "Well, that's respect, I expect,"</p>
    <p data-start="430.16" data-end="438.36">“難道你看不出這些是陌生人，應該尊重他們嗎？”“哦，那就是尊重了，我想，”</p>
    <p data-start="438.98" data-end="445.72">declared the Clown, and immediately stood upon his head. "Don't mind Mr. Joker," said the Princess to Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="438.98" data-end="445.72">小丑宣稱，隨即站在了頭上。“別在意小丑先生，”公主對桃樂絲說。</p>
    <p data-start="446.42" data-end="466.52">"He is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish." "Oh, I don't mind him a bit," said Dorothy. "But you are so beautiful," she continued, "that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won't you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could carry you in my basket."</p>
    <p data-start="446.42" data-end="466.52">“他頭上的裂縫使他變得愚蠢。” “哦，我一點也不介意他，”桃樂絲說。“但你實在太美了，”她接著說，“我一定會非常喜歡你。你願意讓我帶你回堪薩斯，把你放在艾瑪姨媽的壁爐架上嗎？我可以把你放在我的籃子里。”</p>
    <p data-start="467.46" data-end="500.44">"That would make me very unhappy," answered the china Princess. "You see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country."</p>
    <p data-start="467.46" data-end="500.44">“那會讓我非常不高興，”瓷器公主回答。“你看，我們在這裡過得很愉快，可以隨心所欲地談話和活動。但一旦我們被帶走，我們的關節會立刻僵硬，只能筆直地站著，顯得漂亮。當我們在壁爐架、櫥櫃和客廳桌子上時，這些就是我們的期望，但我們在自己的國家裡生活要愉快得多。”</p>
    <p data-start="501.24" data-end="507.70">"I would not make you unhappy for all the world!" exclaimed Dorothy. "So I'll just say good-bye."</p>
    <p data-start="501.24" data-end="507.70">“我絕不會讓你不高興的！”桃樂絲驚呼。“所以我會說再見了。”</p>
    <p data-start="508.60" data-end="527.02">"Good-bye," replied the Princess. They walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall.</p>
    <p data-start="508.60" data-end="527.02">“再見，”公主回道。他們小心翼翼地穿越了瓷器國度。小動物和所有人都跑到一邊，生怕陌生人會弄壞他們。大約一小時後，旅行者來到了國度的另一邊，來到另一道瓷器牆前。</p>
    <p data-start="527.92" data-end="535.52">It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the Lion's back they all managed to scramble to the top.</p>
    <p data-start="527.92" data-end="535.52">然而，這道牆比第一道低，他們站在獅子的背上，成功地爬到了牆頂。</p>
    <p data-start="536.42" data-end="547.68">Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces.</p>
    <p data-start="536.42" data-end="547.68">然後獅子把四條腿縮在身下，跳到了牆上；但就在他跳的時候，他的尾巴撞翻了一座瓷器教堂，把它撞得粉碎。</p>
    <p data-start="548.58" data-end="557.56">"That was too bad," said Dorothy, "but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow's leg and a church. They are all so brittle!"</p>
    <p data-start="548.58" data-end="557.56">“那真是太糟糕了，”桃樂絲說，“但我真的覺得我們很幸運，沒有對這些小人造成比摔壞一頭牛的腿和一座教堂更大的傷害。他們實在是太脆弱了！”</p>
    <p data-start="557.78" data-end="572.02">"They are, indeed," said the Scarecrow, "and I am thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow."</p>
    <p data-start="557.78" data-end="572.02">“確實如此，”稻草人說，“我很慶幸自己是由稻草做的，不容易損壞。這世上有比當稻草人更糟糕的事情。”</p>
