    <p data-start="13.82" data-end="14.70" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十八章：前往南方</p>
    <p data-start="16.10" data-end="33.86">Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her companions. The Tin Woodman came to her and said:</p>
    <p data-start="16.10" data-end="33.86">桃樂絲對於希望再次回到堪薩斯的破滅而痛哭流涕；但當她仔細想過之後，她慶幸自己沒有乘坐氣球上去。她對失去奧茲感到難過，她的同伴們也是如此。錫樵夫走到她身邊說：</p>
    <p data-start="34.48" data-end="46.76">"Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust."</p>
    <p data-start="34.48" data-end="46.76">「如果我不為給了我這顆可愛心臟的人哀悼，那我真的太忘恩負義了。我想哭一會兒，因為奧茲走了，如果你能幫我擦掉眼淚，我就不會生鏽了。」</p>
    <p data-start="46.76" data-end="67.48">"With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap.</p>
    <p data-start="46.76" data-end="67.48">「很樂意幫忙。」她回答，立刻拿來一條毛巾。然後錫樵夫哭了好幾分鐘，她仔細地看著他的眼淚，並用毛巾擦掉它們。當他哭完後，他感謝了她，並用他的寶石油壺徹底地給自己上了油，以防止出現意外。</p>
    <p data-start="68.86" data-end="85.30">The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him. "For," they said, "there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man." And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.</p>
    <p data-start="68.86" data-end="85.30">稻草人現在是翡翠城的統治者，雖然他不是一個巫師，但人們為他感到驕傲。「因為，」他們說，「世界上沒有另一個城市是由一個塞滿稻草的人統治的。」而且，就他們所知，他們是完全正確的。</p>
    <p data-start="86.54" data-end="96.96">The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.</p>
    <p data-start="86.54" data-end="96.96">氣球帶著奧茲升空的第二天早上，四位旅行者在寶座室會面並討論了事情。稻草人坐在大寶座上，其他人恭敬地站在他面前。</p>
    <p data-start="97.90" data-end="106.38">"We are not so unlucky," said the new ruler, "for this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please.</p>
    <p data-start="97.90" data-end="106.38">「我們並不那麼不幸，」新統治者說，「因為這座宮殿和翡翠城屬於我們，我們可以隨心所欲地行事。</p>
    <p data-start="107.16" data-end="135.70">When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite satisfied with my lot." "I also," said the Tin Woodman, "am well-pleased with my new heart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world." "For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived, if not braver," said the Lion modestly.</p>
    <p data-start="107.16" data-end="135.70">當我想起不久前我還在農夫的玉米地裡的柱子上，現在我卻成了這座美麗城市的統治者，我對自己的處境非常滿意。」 「我也是，」錫樵夫說，「對我的新心臟非常滿意；事實上，那是我在世界上唯一想要的東西。」 「就我而言，我很滿足於知道自己像歷史上任何一隻野獸一樣勇敢，如果不是更勇敢的話。」獅子謙虛地說。</p>
    <p data-start="136.54" data-end="143.76">"If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City," continued the Scarecrow, "we might all be happy together."</p>
    <p data-start="136.54" data-end="143.76">「如果桃樂絲能滿足於住在翡翠城，」稻草人繼續說，「我們或許都能一起幸福。」</p>
    <p data-start="144.32" data-end="173.48">"But I don't want to live here," cried Dorothy. "I want to go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry." "Well, then, what can be done?" inquired the Woodman. The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said: "Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the desert?" "I never thought of that!" said Dorothy joyfully.</p>
    <p data-start="144.32" data-end="173.48">「但我不想住在這裡，」桃樂絲喊道。「我想回堪薩斯，和艾姆嬸嬸和亨利叔叔住在一起。」 「那麼，該怎麼辦呢？」錫樵夫問道。稻草人決定思考，他想得如此之深，以至於針和大頭針開始從他的腦袋裡冒出來。最後他說：「為什麼不召喚飛猴，讓他們帶你越過沙漠呢？」 「我從沒想過這個！」桃樂絲高興地說。</p>
    <p data-start="173.58" data-end="188.50">"It's just the thing. I'll go at once for the Golden Cap." When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her.</p>
    <p data-start="173.58" data-end="188.50">「這正是辦法。我立刻去拿金帽子。」當她把金帽子帶到寶座室時，她念了咒語，很快一群飛猴就從打開的窗戶飛進來，站在她身旁。</p>
    <p data-start="189.78" data-end="195.60">"This is the second time you have called us," said the Monkey King, bowing before the little girl. "What do you wish?"</p>
    <p data-start="189.78" data-end="195.60">「這是你第二次召喚我們。」猴王在小女孩面前鞠躬說道。「你有什麼願望？」</p>
    <p data-start="196.58" data-end="203.72">"I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said Dorothy. But the Monkey King shook his head.</p>
    <p data-start="196.58" data-end="203.72">「我想讓你帶我飛到堪薩斯。」桃樂絲說。但猴王搖了搖頭。</p>
    <p data-start="203.82" data-end="222.74">"That cannot be done," he said. "We belong to this country alone, and cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet, and I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert. Good-bye."</p>
    <p data-start="203.82" data-end="222.74">「這不可能，」他說。「我們只屬於這個國家，不能離開它。從來沒有一隻飛猴去過堪薩斯，我想將來也不會有，因為它們不屬於那裡。我們很樂意為你做任何我們能做到的事情，但我們不能穿越沙漠。再見了。」</p>
    <p data-start="224.38" data-end="230.78">And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window, followed by all his band.</p>
    <p data-start="224.38" data-end="230.78">然後又是一鞠躬，猴王展開翅膀，從窗戶飛走了，他的所有手下也跟著飛走了。</p>
    <p data-start="230.78" data-end="244.94">Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. "I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose," she said, "for the Winged Monkeys cannot help me."</p>
    <p data-start="230.78" data-end="244.94">桃樂絲失望得快要哭了。「我白白浪費了金帽子的魔力，」她說，「因為飛猴幫不了我。」</p>
    <p data-start="244.94" data-end="257.88">"It is certainly too bad!" said the tender-hearted Woodman. The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst. "Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,"</p>
    <p data-start="244.94" data-end="257.88">「這真是太糟糕了！」善良的錫樵夫說。稻草人又開始思考，他的頭脹得可怕，桃樂絲擔心它會爆裂。「讓我們叫綠鬍子的士兵來，」</p>
    <p data-start="258.00" data-end="270.98">he said, "and ask his advice." So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.</p>
    <p data-start="258.00" data-end="270.98">他說，「問問他的建議。」於是士兵被召來，並膽怯地走進寶座室，因為奧茲在世時，他從未被允許走過門口。</p>
    <p data-start="271.28" data-end="288.40">"This little girl," said the Scarecrow to the soldier, "wishes to cross the desert. How can she do so?" "I cannot tell," answered the soldier, "for nobody has ever crossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself." "Is there no one who can help me?" asked Dorothy earnestly.</p>
    <p data-start="271.28" data-end="288.40">「這個小女孩，」稻草人對士兵說，「想要穿越沙漠。她怎麼才能做到呢？」 「我不知道，」士兵回答，「因為沒有人曾經穿越過沙漠，除了奧茲本人。」 「沒有誰能幫助我嗎？」桃樂絲急切地問。</p>
    <p data-start="289.46" data-end="306.62">"Glinda might," he suggested. "Who is Glinda?" inquired the Scarecrow. "The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches, and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert, so she may know a way to cross it."</p>
    <p data-start="289.46" data-end="306.62">「葛林達或許可以，」他建議道。 「葛林達是誰？」稻草人問。 「南方女巫。她是所有女巫中最強大的，統治著夸德林人。此外，她的城堡坐落在沙漠的邊緣，所以她可能知道穿越它的方法。」</p>
    <p data-start="307.40" data-end="323.62">"Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?" asked the child. "The Quadlings think she is good," said the soldier, "and she is kind to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."</p>
    <p data-start="307.40" data-end="323.62">「葛林達是好女巫，不是嗎？」孩子問。「夸德林人認為她是好的，」士兵說，「她對每個人都很和善。我聽說葛林達是一位美麗的女人，知道如何保持年輕，儘管她已經活了很多年。」</p>
    <p data-start="324.46" data-end="343.22">"How can I get to her castle?" asked Dorothy. "The road is straight to the South," he answered, "but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City."</p>
    <p data-start="324.46" data-end="343.22">「我怎麼能到她的城堡？」桃樂絲問。 「道路一直向南，」他回答，「但據說充滿了對旅行者的危險。森林裡有野獸，還有一群奇怪的人，他們不喜歡陌生人穿越他們的國家。因此沒有夸德林人來過翡翠城。」</p>
    <p data-start="343.34" data-end="362.50">The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said: "It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas."</p>
    <p data-start="343.34" data-end="362.50">士兵然後離開了他們，稻草人說：「儘管有危險，看來桃樂絲最好的辦法是前往南方之地，請求葛林達的幫助。因為，當然，如果桃樂絲留在這裡，她永遠無法回到堪薩斯。」</p>
    <p data-start="362.58" data-end="369.66">"You must have been thinking again," remarked the Tin Woodman. "I have," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="362.58" data-end="369.66">「你一定又在思考了。」錫樵夫說。「沒錯。」稻草人說。</p>
    <p data-start="370.94" data-end="378.54">"I shall go with Dorothy," declared the Lion, "for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again.</p>
    <p data-start="370.94" data-end="378.54">「我要和桃樂絲一起去，」獅子宣稱，「因為我厭倦了你的城市，渴望回到森林和鄉村。</p>
    <p data-start="379.06" data-end="387.50">I am really a wild beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her." "That is true," agreed the Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="379.06" data-end="387.50">我是個真正的野獸，你知道。此外，桃樂絲需要有人保護她。」 「這是真的，」錫樵夫同意。</p>
    <p data-start="387.80" data-end="398.74">"My axe may be of service to her; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South." "When shall we start?" asked the Scarecrow. "Are you going?" they asked, in surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="387.80" data-end="398.74">「我的斧頭可能對她有用；所以我也會和她一起去南方之地。」 「我們什麼時候出發？」稻草人問。「你也要去嗎？」他們驚訝地問。</p>
    <p data-start="399.84" data-end="416.50">"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains. She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all."</p>
    <p data-start="399.84" data-end="416.50">「當然。如果不是因為桃樂絲，我就不會有大腦。她把我從玉米田的柱子上解救下來，帶我到翡翠城。所以我的好運全靠她，我永遠不會離開她，直到她徹底回到堪薩斯為止。」</p>
    <p data-start="416.98" data-end="434.44">"Thank you," said Dorothy gratefully. "You are all very kind to me. But I should like to start as soon as possible." "We shall go tomorrow morning," returned the Scarecrow. "So now let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey."</p>
    <p data-start="416.98" data-end="434.44">「謝謝你，」桃樂絲感激地說。「你們都對我很好。但我希望盡快出發。」 「我們明天早上就走，」稻草人回答。「現在讓我們都準備一下，因為這將是一次漫長的旅程。」</p>
