    <p data-start="8.74" data-end="14.94">...IN WHICH WE ARE INTRODUCED TO WINNIE-THE-POOH AND SOME BEES, AND THE STORIES BEGIN</p>
    <p data-start="8.74" data-end="14.94">……在這章中，我們將認識小熊維尼和一些蜜蜂，故事就此展開</p>
    <p data-start="17.44" data-end="46.44">HERE is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="17.44" data-end="46.44">這裡是愛德華熊，現在正一階一階地下樓，咚、咚、咚，他的後腦勺碰著台階，跟在克里斯多夫·羅賓後面。據他所知，這是下樓的唯一方法，但有時他覺得或許還有另一種方法，只要他能暫停一下，不再咚咚地撞，仔細想一想。不過隨後他又覺得，也許根本沒有別的方法。總之，他現在到了樓下，準備介紹給你認識了。這就是小熊維尼。</p>
    <p data-start="48.08" data-end="74.22">When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, "But I thought he was a boy?" "So did I," said Christopher Robin. "Then you can't call him Winnie?" "I don't." "But you said--" "He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what 'ther' means?" "Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it is all the explanation you are going to get.</p>
    <p data-start="48.08" data-end="74.22">當我第一次聽到他的名字時，我說，就像你將要說的那樣，“但我以為他是個男孩？”“我也這麼以為，”克里斯多夫·羅賓說。“那你不能叫他維尼吧？”“我沒有這麼叫。”“但你說——”“他是小熊‘維尼-ther-普’。你不知道‘ther’是什麼意思嗎？”“啊，是的，我現在知道了，”我趕緊說；我希望你也知道，因為這就是你將得到的全部解釋。</p>
    <p data-start="74.23" data-end="119.90">Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening—— "What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.  "What about a story?" I said. "Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?" "I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories does he like?" "About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear."  "Oh, I see." "So could you very sweetly?"  "I'll try," I said. So I tried.</p>
    <p data-start="74.23" data-end="119.90">有時小熊維尼下樓時喜歡玩些遊戲，有時他喜歡靜靜地坐在火爐前聽故事。今晚——「講個故事怎麼樣？」克里斯多夫·羅賓說。「講個故事怎麼樣？」我說。「你能很甜蜜地給小熊維尼講一個嗎？」「我想我可以。」我說。「他喜歡什麼樣的故事？」「關於他的故事。因為他就是那種熊。」「哦，我明白了。」「那你能很甜蜜地講一個嗎？」「我會試試看。」我說。於是我試了試。</p>
    <p data-start="119.92" data-end="138.10">Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders. （"What does 'under the name' mean?" asked Christopher Robin. "It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it."</p>
    <p data-start="119.92" data-end="138.10">從前，很久很久以前，大約是上週五，小熊維尼獨自住在一片森林裡，名字叫桑德斯。（“‘名字叫’是什麼意思？”克里斯多夫·羅賓問。“這意味著他的名字用金字母寫在門上，而他住在這名字下面。”</p>
    <p data-start="139.18" data-end="174.90">"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure," said Christopher Robin. "Now I am," said a growly voice. "Then I will go on," said I.） One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing- noise. Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think.</p>
    <p data-start="139.18" data-end="174.90">“小熊維尼不太確定，”克里斯多夫·羅賓說。“現在我知道了，”一個低沉的聲音說。“那麼我繼續說吧，”我說。）有一天，他出去散步，來到森林中央的一塊空地上，在這塊空地的中央有一棵大橡樹，從樹頂傳來嗡嗡的聲音。小熊維尼坐在樹底下，把頭放在爪子中間，開始思考。</p>
    <p data-start="174.92" data-end="209.08">First of all he said to himself: "That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee." Then he thought another long time, and said: "And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey."</p>
    <p data-start="174.92" data-end="209.08">首先，他對自己說：“這嗡嗡聲意味著什麼。你不會平白無故聽到這樣的嗡嗡聲，光是嗡嗡作響，沒有意義。如果有嗡嗡聲，那麼一定是有人在發出這個聲音，而我所知道的唯一發出嗡嗡聲的原因是你是一隻蜜蜂。”然後他又想了很久，說：“而我所知道的成為蜜蜂的唯一原因是為了製造蜂蜜。”</p>
    <p data-start="209.08" data-end="267.82">And then he got up, and said: "And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it." So he began to climb the tree He climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself. It went like this: Isn't it funny How a bear likes honey? Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I wonder why he does? Then he climbed a little further. . . and a little further . . . and then just a little further. By that time he had thought of another song. It's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees, They'd build their nests at the bottom of trees. And that being so (if the Bees were Bears), We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.</p>
    <p data-start="209.08" data-end="267.82">接著他站起來，說：“而製造蜂蜜的唯一原因是讓我可以吃它。”所以他開始爬樹。他爬呀爬呀，邊爬邊自言自語地唱起了一首小歌。歌詞是這樣的：是不是很有趣 一隻熊喜歡蜂蜜？嗡！嗡！嗡！ 我想知道為什麼？然後他又爬了一點……再爬一點……接著再爬一點。這時他又想起了另一首歌。這是一個很有趣的想法，如果熊是蜜蜂，牠們會把巢築在樹底下。既然如此（如果蜜蜂是熊），我們就不必爬這些樓梯了。</p>
    <p data-start="269.74" data-end="310.68">He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a Complaining Song. He was nearly there now, and if he just s t o o d o n t h a t branch . . . Crack ! "Oh, help!" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him. "If only I hadn't--" he said, as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch. "You see, what I meant to do," he explained, as he turned head-over-heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below, "what I meant to do--" "Of course, it was rather--"</p>
    <p data-start="269.74" data-end="310.68">這時候，他已經有點累了，這就是為什麼他唱了一首抱怨的歌。他快要到達了，如果他只是站在那根樹枝上……咔嚓！“哦，救命啊！”維尼說，當他掉到下面的樹枝上時，大約有十英尺高。“要是我沒——”他說著，又彈到下一根樹枝上，這次彈了二十英尺。“你看，我本來打算做的是，”他解釋道，當他頭朝下翻滾，砰的一聲撞到下面三十英尺處的另一根樹枝時，“我本來想做的是——”“當然，那真是——”</p>
    <p data-start="311.04" data-end="340.94">he admitted, as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches. "It all comes, I suppose," he decided, as he said good-bye to the last branch, spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush, "it all comes of liking honey so much. Oh, help!" He crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the prickles from his nose, and began to think again.</p>
    <p data-start="311.04" data-end="340.94">他承認道，當他非常迅速地滑過接下來的六根樹枝時。“我想，這一切都源於我太喜歡蜂蜜了。”他在說再見最後一根樹枝時決定道，旋轉了三圈，優雅地飛進了荊豆叢裡，“這一切都是因為我太喜歡蜂蜜了。哦，救命啊！”他從荊豆叢裡爬出來，刷掉鼻子上的刺，然後開始再次思考。</p>
    <p data-start="341.52" data-end="370.88">And the first person he thought of was Christopher Robin. ("Was that me?" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring to believe it. "That was you." Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger and larger, and his face got pinker and pinker.) So Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin, who lived behind a green door in another part of the Forest.</p>
    <p data-start="341.52" data-end="370.88">他想到的第一個人就是克里斯多夫·羅賓。（“那是我嗎？”克里斯多夫·羅賓用敬畏的聲音說，幾乎不敢相信。“那是你。”克里斯多夫·羅賓沒有說話，但他的眼睛越來越大，臉越來越紅。）於是小熊維尼來到他的朋友克里斯多夫·羅賓那裡，他住在森林另一部分的一扇綠色門後面。</p>
    <p data-start="372.50" data-end="400.38">"Good morning, Christopher Robin," he said. "Good morning, Winnie-ther-Pooh," said you. "I wonder if you've got such a thing as a balloon about you?" "A balloon?" "Yes, I just said to myself coming along: 'I wonder if Christopher Robin has such a thing as a balloon about him?' I just said it to myself, thinking of balloons, and wondering."</p>
    <p data-start="372.50" data-end="400.38">“早安，克里斯多夫·羅賓，”他說。“早安，小熊維尼，”你說。“我在想，你有沒有氣球？”“氣球？”“是的，我剛才自己在路上說：‘我在想克里斯多夫·羅賓有沒有一個氣球？’我只是自己在說，想着氣球，然後好奇。”</p>
    <p data-start="400.96" data-end="430.66">"What do you want a balloon for?" you said. Winnie-the-Pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening, put his paw to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper: "Honey!" "But you don't get honey with balloons!" "I do," said Pooh. Well, it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend Piglet,</p>
    <p data-start="400.96" data-end="430.66">“你要氣球做什麼？”你說。小熊維尼環顧四周，確保沒有人在聽，然後把爪子放在嘴邊，低聲說：“蜂蜜！”“可是你不能用氣球拿到蜂蜜啊！”“我能，”維尼說。嗯，正好你前一天去參加了你朋友小豬家的派對，</p>
    <p data-start="430.82" data-end="453.38">and you had balloons at the party. You had had a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit's relations had had a big blue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you.</p>
    <p data-start="430.82" data-end="453.38">派對上有氣球。你有一個大大的綠色氣球；兔子的一個親戚有一個大大的藍色氣球，但因為他實在太小了，不適合參加派對，所以他把氣球落在那裡了，於是你把綠色的和藍色的氣球一起帶回了家。</p>
    <p data-start="453.40" data-end="482.50">"Which one would you like?" you asked Pooh. He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully. "It's like this," he said. "When you go after honey with a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming. Now, if you have a green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree, and not notice you,</p>
    <p data-start="453.40" data-end="482.50">“你想要哪一個？”你問維尼。他把頭放在爪子中間，非常仔細地思考著。“事情是這樣的，”他說，“當你用氣球去找蜂蜜時，最重要的是不要讓蜜蜂知道你來了。現在，如果你拿的是綠色氣球，牠們可能會認為你只是樹的一部分，注意不到你，</p>
    <p data-start="483.22" data-end="495.96">and if you have a blue balloon, they might think you were only part of the sky, and not notice you, and the question is: Which is most likely?"</p>
    <p data-start="483.22" data-end="495.96">而如果你拿的是藍色氣球，牠們可能會認為你只是天空的一部分，也注意不到你，問題是：哪一種情況最有可能發生？”</p>
    <p data-start="497.00" data-end="500.20">"Wouldn't they notice you underneath the balloon?" you asked.</p>
    <p data-start="497.00" data-end="500.20">“那牠們不會注意到氣球下面的你嗎？”你問。</p>
    <p data-start="502.04" data-end="560.64">"They might or they might not," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "You never can tell with bees." He thought for a moment and said: "I shall try to look like a small black cloud. That will deceive them." "Then you had better have the blue balloon," you said; and so it was decided. Well, you both went out with the blue balloon, and you took your gun with you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the- Pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and rolled until he was black all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big, and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let go suddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed there--level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it.</p>
    <p data-start="502.04" data-end="560.64">“可能會，也可能不會，”小熊維尼說。“對蜜蜂，你永遠無法確定。”他想了一會兒，說：“我要努力看起來像一朵小黑雲。這樣就能騙過牠們了。”“那你最好用藍色氣球，”你說。於是就這麼決定了。好吧，你們兩個就帶著藍色氣球出發了，你還帶著你的槍，以防萬一，正如你一貫的做法。小熊維尼來到他知道的一個非常泥濘的地方，在那裡滾來滾去，直到全身都變成黑色的；然後，當氣球吹得像最大的一樣大時，你和維尼一起抓住繩子，突然放手，然後維尼熊優雅地飄上天空，停留在與樹頂齊平並且離樹大約二十英尺的地方。</p>
    <p data-start="561.02" data-end="617.12">"Hooray!" you shouted. "Isn't that fine?" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you. "What do I look like?" "You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon," you said. "Not," said Pooh anxiously, "--not like a small black cloud in a blue sky?" "Not very much." "Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different. And, as I say, you never can tell with bees." There was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so there he stayed. He could see the honey, he could smell the honey, but he couldn't quite reach the honey. After a little while he called down to you. "Christopher Robin!" he said in a loud whisper. "Hallo!"</p>
    <p data-start="561.02" data-end="617.12">“萬歲！”你喊道。“是不是很棒？”小熊維尼對著你喊道。“我看起來像什麼？”“你看起來像一隻抓著氣球的熊，”你說。“不是，”維尼焦慮地說，“不像藍天下的一朵小黑雲嗎？”“不太像。”“啊，好吧，也許從這上面看起來會不一樣。正如我說的，你永遠無法確定蜜蜂會怎麼想。”當時沒有風把他吹向樹，所以他就停留在那裡。他能看到蜂蜜，聞到蜂蜜的味道，但就是夠不到蜂蜜。過了一會兒，他對你低聲喊道：“克里斯多夫·羅賓！”“哈囉！”</p>
    <p data-start="618.56" data-end="646.04">"I think the bees suspect something!" "What sort of thing?" "I don't know. But something tells me that they're suspicious!" "Perhaps they think that you're after their honey?" "It may be that. You never can tell with bees." There was another little silence, and then he called down to you again.</p>
    <p data-start="618.56" data-end="646.04">“我想蜜蜂們開始懷疑了！”“懷疑什麼？”“我不知道。但有什麼東西告訴我，牠們開始懷疑了！”“也許牠們認為你要來偷牠們的蜂蜜？”“有可能。你永遠無法確定蜜蜂會怎麼想。”過了一會兒，他又對你喊道。</p>
    <p data-start="647.22" data-end="679.40">"Christopher Robin!" "Yes?" "Have you an umbrella in your house?" "I think so." "I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up and down with it, and look up at me every now and then, and say 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain.' I think, if you did that, it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees." Well, you laughed to yourself,</p>
    <p data-start="647.22" data-end="679.40">“克里斯多夫·羅賓！”“怎麼了？”“你家裡有沒有雨傘？”“我想應該有。”“我希望你能把它拿到這裡來，然後拿著它來回走動，時不時地抬頭看看我，然後說‘嘖嘖，天好像要下雨了。’我想，如果你這麼做，會幫助我們對這些蜜蜂進行的偽裝。”好吧，你對自己笑了，</p>
    <p data-start="680.44" data-end="691.20">"Silly old Bear !" but you didn't say it aloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your umbrella. "Oh, there you are!"</p>
    <p data-start="680.44" data-end="691.20">“傻老熊！”但你沒有大聲說出來，因為你非常喜歡他，於是你回家拿了你的雨傘。“哦，你來了！”</p>
    <p data-start="691.82" data-end="720.66">called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got back to the tree. "I was beginning to get anxious. I have discovered that the bees are now definitely Suspicious." "Shall I put my umbrella up?" you said. "Yes, but wait a moment. We must be practical. The important bee to deceive is the Queen Bee. Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down there?"</p>
    <p data-start="691.82" data-end="720.66">小熊維尼在你回到樹下時喊道。“我開始有點擔心了。我發現這些蜜蜂現在顯然是起疑了。”“我要打開我的雨傘嗎？”你問。“是的，但等一下。我們必須實事求是。最重要的是要欺騙蜂后。你能從下面看到哪隻是蜂后嗎？”</p>
    <p data-start="721.72" data-end="751.62">"No." "A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying, 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain,' I shall do what I can by singing a little Cloud Song, such as a cloud might sing. . . . Go!" So, while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain, Winnie-the-Pooh sang this song:</p>
    <p data-start="721.72" data-end="751.62">“看不到。”“真可惜。好吧，現在，如果你拿著雨傘來回走動，說著‘嘖嘖，天好像要下雨了’，我會通過唱一首小雲的歌來做我的部分……開始吧！”於是，當你來回走動，想著是不是要下雨時，小熊維尼唱起了這首歌：</p>
    <p data-start="752.72" data-end="767.40">How sweet to be a Cloud Floating in the Blue! Every little cloud Always sings aloud. "How sweet to be a Cloud Floating in the Blue!" It makes him very proud To be a little cloud.</p>
    <p data-start="752.72" data-end="767.40">當一朵雲真甜蜜 飄在藍天裡！每朵小雲 都愛大聲唱。當一朵雲真甜蜜 飄在藍天裡！讓他感到驕傲的是 成為一朵小雲。</p>
    <p data-start="768.80" data-end="778.58">The bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever. Some of them indeed left their nest and flew all around the cloud as began the second verse of this song.</p>
    <p data-start="768.80" data-end="778.58">蜜蜂們仍然像往常一樣懷疑地嗡嗡作響。事實上，有些蜜蜂離開了它們的巢，開始圍著這朵雲飛來飛去，這時他開始唱這首歌的第二段。</p>
    <p data-start="779.24" data-end="785.26">The bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever. Some of them, indeed, left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of this song, and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment, and then got up again.</p>
    <p data-start="779.24" data-end="785.26">蜜蜂們仍然像往常一樣懷疑地嗡嗡作響。事實上，有些蜜蜂離開了它們的巢，開始圍著這朵雲飛來飛去，當它開始唱這首歌的第二段時，有一隻蜜蜂在雲的鼻子上坐了一會兒，然後又飛走了。</p>
    <p data-start="786.54" data-end="799.42">"Christopher--ow!--Robin," called out the cloud. "Yes?" "I have just been thinking, and I have come to a very important decision.</p>
    <p data-start="786.54" data-end="799.42">“克里斯多夫——哎喲！——羅賓，”雲喊道。“怎麼了？”“我剛才在想，我做了一個非常重要的決定。</p>
    <p data-start="800.92" data-end="813.50">These are the wrong sort of bees." "Are they?" "Quite the wrong sort. So I should think they would make the wrong sort of honey, shouldn't you?" "Would they?"</p>
    <p data-start="800.92" data-end="813.50">這些是錯誤種類的蜜蜂。”“是嗎？”“完全是錯誤的。所以我想它們應該會釀出錯誤的蜂蜜，你不覺得嗎？”“會嗎？”</p>
    <p data-start="814.32" data-end="831.86">"Yes. So I think I shall come down." "How?" asked you. Winnie-the-Pooh hadn't thought about this. If he let go of the string, he would fall--bump--and he didn't like the idea of that.</p>
    <p data-start="814.32" data-end="831.86">“是的。所以我想我應該下去。”“怎麼下來？”你問道。小熊維尼還沒有考慮到這一點。如果他放開繩子，他會掉下來——砰——而他不喜歡這個主意。</p>
    <p data-start="832.90" data-end="861.98">So he thought for a long time, and then he said: "Christopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun. Have you got your gun?" "Of course I have," you said. "But if I do that, it will spoil the balloon," you said. But if you don't" said Pooh, "I shall have to let go, and that would spoil me." When he put it like this, you saw how it was,</p>
    <p data-start="832.90" data-end="861.98">於是他想了很久，然後他說：“克里斯多夫·羅賓，你必須用你的槍射擊氣球。你有帶槍嗎？”“當然有，”你說。“但是如果我這麼做，氣球就會壞掉，”你說。“但是如果你不射擊，”小熊維尼說，“我就得放開繩子，那樣我就會受傷。”當他這麼說時，你明白了情況，</p>
    <p data-start="862.00" data-end="890.22">and you aimed very carefully at the balloon, and fired. "Ow!" said Pooh. "Did I miss?" you asked. "You didn't exactly miss," said Pooh, "but you missed the balloon." "I'm so sorry," you said, and you fired again, and this time you hit the balloon and the air came slowly out, and Winnie-the-Pooh floated down to the ground.</p>
    <p data-start="862.00" data-end="890.22">你非常仔細地瞄準氣球，開槍了。“哎喲！”小熊維尼說。“我打偏了嗎？”你問道。“你不算是打偏了，”小熊維尼說，“但你沒有打中氣球。”“我很抱歉，”你說。於是你又開了一槍，這次你打中了氣球，氣球裡的空氣慢慢漏了出來，小熊維尼也慢慢地飄回到了地面。</p>
    <p data-start="891.20" data-end="920.98">But his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think--but I am not sure--that that is why he was always called Pooh. "Is that the end of the story?" asked Christopher Robin. "That's the end of that one. There are others." "About Pooh and Me?"</p>
