    <p data-start="9.92" data-end="13.92">...IN WHICH PIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP</p>
    <p data-start="9.92" data-end="13.92">...在這章裡，小豬遇見了小象</p>
    <p data-start="17.02" data-end="28.48">ONE day, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were all talking together, Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was eating and said carelessly: "I saw a Heffalump to- day, Piglet."</p>
    <p data-start="17.02" data-end="28.48">有一天，當小熊維尼和小豬與克里斯多夫·羅賓在一起聊天時，克里斯多夫·羅賓吃完了口中的食物，隨意地說：「今天我看到了一隻小象，小豬。」</p>
    <p data-start="28.64" data-end="49.78">"What was it doing?" asked Piglet. "Just lumping along," said Christopher Robin. "I don't think it saw me." "I saw one once," said Piglet. "At least, I think I did," he said. "Only perhaps it wasn't."</p>
    <p data-start="28.64" data-end="49.78">「牠在做什麼？」小豬問道。「只是慢吞吞地走著，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說。「我想牠沒看到我。」「我也曾經看見過一隻，」小豬說。「至少，我想我是看見過，」他說。「只是可能並不是。」</p>
    <p data-start="50.20" data-end="62.36">"So did I," said Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like. "You don't often see them," said Christopher Robin carelessly. "Not now," said Piglet. "Not at this time of year," said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="50.20" data-end="62.36">「我也是，」小熊維尼說，心裡想著小象到底長什麼樣子。「你不常見到牠們的，」克里斯多夫·羅賓漫不經心地說。「現在不會了，」小豬說。「這個季節不會，」小熊維尼說。</p>
    <p data-start="62.96" data-end="70.00">Then they all talked about something else, until it was time for Pooh and Piglet to go home together.</p>
    <p data-start="62.96" data-end="70.00">然後他們談論起其他的事情，直到該是小熊維尼和小豬一起回家的時候。</p>
    <p data-start="70.96" data-end="79.54">At first as they stumped along the path which edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn't say much to each other; but when they came to the stream,</p>
    <p data-start="70.96" data-end="79.54">起初，他們沿著百畝森林邊緣的小路走著，彼此之間沒說太多話；但當他們來到小溪邊，</p>
    <p data-start="79.56" data-end="109.46">and had helped each other across the stepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the heather, they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and Piglet said, "If you see what I mean, Pooh," and Pooh said, "It's just what I think myself, Piglet," and Piglet said, "But, on the other hand, Pooh, we must remember," and Pooh said, "Quite true, Piglet,</p>
    <p data-start="79.56" data-end="109.46">並互相幫助跨過那些石頭，重新能夠並肩走在石楠叢中時，他們開始友好地聊些有的沒的，小豬說：「如果你明白我的意思，小熊維尼，」小熊維尼說：「這正是我自己所想的，小豬，」小豬說：「但另一方面，小熊維尼，我們必須記住，」小熊維尼說：「沒錯，小豬，</p>
    <p data-start="109.48" data-end="116.92">although I had forgotten it for the moment." And then, just as they came to the Six Pine Trees,</p>
    <p data-start="109.48" data-end="116.92">儘管我一時忘記了。」然後，就在他們來到六棵松樹旁時，</p>
    <p data-start="116.92" data-end="125.42">Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and said in a very solemn voice: "Piglet, I have decided something."</p>
    <p data-start="116.92" data-end="125.42">小熊維尼環顧四周，確保沒有人在聽，然後用非常嚴肅的語氣說：「小豬，我已經決定了一件事。」</p>
    <p data-start="126.00" data-end="135.48">"What have you decided, Pooh?" "I have decided to catch a Heffalump."</p>
    <p data-start="126.00" data-end="135.48">「你決定了什麼，小熊維尼？」「我決定要抓一隻小象。」</p>
    <p data-start="135.70" data-end="163.58">Pooh nodded his head several times as he said this, and waited for Piglet to say "How?" or "Pooh, you couldn't!" or something helpful of that sort, but Piglet said nothing. The fact was Piglet was wishing that he had thought about it first. "I shall do it," said Pooh, after waiting a little longer, "by means of a trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet."</p>
    <p data-start="135.70" data-end="163.58">小熊維尼點了點頭，說這話時重複了幾次，並等著小豬說「怎麼抓？」或「小熊維尼，你不可能的！」或者類似的幫助性話語，但小豬什麼也沒說。事實上，小豬在心裡想，他真希望自己能先想到這個。「我要用陷阱來抓，」小熊維尼說，等了一會兒後，「這必須是一個狡猾的陷阱，所以你得幫我，小豬。」</p>
    <p data-start="165.50" data-end="193.34">"Pooh," said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, "I will." And then he said, "How shall we do it?" and Pooh said, "That's just it. How?" And then they sat down together to think it out. Pooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the Heffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and--</p>
    <p data-start="165.50" data-end="193.34">「小熊維尼，」小豬說，現在心情又變得非常愉快，「我會的。」然後他說：「我們要怎麼做？」小熊維尼說：「這正是問題所在，怎麼做呢？」然後他們一起坐下來想出辦法。小熊維尼的第一個想法是他們應該挖一個非常深的坑，然後小象走過來就會掉進坑裡，然後--</p>
    <p data-start="193.54" data-end="222.90">"Why?" said Piglet. "Why what?" said Pooh. "Why would he fall in?" Pooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be walking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky, wondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down, when it would be too late. Piglet said that this was a very good Trap,</p>
    <p data-start="193.54" data-end="222.90">「為什麼？」小豬說。「為什麼什麼？」小熊維尼說。「牠為什麼會掉進去？」小熊維尼用爪子揉了揉鼻子，說小象可能會走著走著，哼著小曲，抬頭望著天空，想知道會不會下雨，所以牠不會看到這個非常深的坑，直到牠已經掉到一半，才發現已經太遲了。小豬說這是一個非常好的陷阱，</p>
    <p data-start="223.62" data-end="248.18">but supposing it were raining already? Pooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn't thought of that. And then he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already, the Heffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would clear up, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down.... When it would be too late.</p>
    <p data-start="223.62" data-end="248.18">但如果已經在下雨了呢？小熊維尼又揉了揉鼻子，說他還沒想到這個。然後他眼睛一亮，說如果已經在下雨，小象會抬頭看著天空，想知道雨會不會停，所以牠不會看到這個非常深的坑，直到牠已經掉到一半... 那時就已經太遲了。</p>
    <p data-start="250.00" data-end="277.82">Piglet said that, now that this point had been explained, he thought it was a Cunning Trap. Pooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump was as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about, and it was this. Where should they dig the Very Deep Pit? Piglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump was, just before he fell into it,</p>
    <p data-start="250.00" data-end="277.82">小豬說，既然這點已經解釋清楚，他認為這是一個狡猾的陷阱。小熊維尼聽了非常自豪，他覺得小象已經等於是抓到了，但還有一件事需要考慮，那就是，他們應該在哪裡挖這個非常深的坑？小豬說，最好的地方是小象剛好在掉進去之前的位置，大約再往前一英尺的地方。</p>
    <p data-start="278.22" data-end="308.10">only about a foot farther on. "But then he would see us digging it," said Pooh. "Not if he was looking at the sky." "He would Suspect," said Pooh, "if he happened to look down." He thought for a long time and then added sadly, "It isn't as easy as I thought. I suppose that's why Heffalumps hardly ever get caught." "That must be it," said Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="278.22" data-end="308.10">「但是這樣他會看到我們在挖坑啊。」小熊維尼說。「如果他在看天空就不會。」小熊維尼說：「如果他剛好低頭看，他會懷疑的。」他想了很久，然後悲傷地補充道：「這不像我想的那麼簡單。我想這就是為什麼小象幾乎從來沒被抓到過的原因。」小豬說：「一定是這樣。」</p>
    <p data-start="308.46" data-end="319.32">They sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying to himself,</p>
    <p data-start="308.46" data-end="319.32">他們嘆了口氣，站起來；當他們把幾根金雀刺從自己身上拔掉後，他們又坐下來；而這時，小熊維尼心裡一直在說，</p>
    <p data-start="320.48" data-end="331.00">"If only I could think of something!" For he felt sure that a Very Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way to go about it.</p>
    <p data-start="320.48" data-end="331.00">「如果我能想到什麼好辦法就好了！」因為他確信，如果他知道該怎麼做，一個非常聰明的大腦就能抓住一隻小象。</p>
    <p data-start="333.22" data-end="362.06">"Suppose," he said to Piglet, "you wanted to catch me, how would you do it?" "Well," said Piglet, "I should do it like this. I should make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and you would go in after it, and--" "And I would go in after it," said Pooh excitedly, "only very carefully so as not to hurt myself,</p>
    <p data-start="333.22" data-end="362.06">「假設，」他對小豬說，「你想抓住我，你會怎麼做？」小豬說：「嗯，我會這樣做。我會設一個陷阱，然後我會在陷阱裡放一罐蜂蜜，你會聞到它，然後你會去找它，然後--」小熊維尼興奮地說：「然後我會去找它，只是非常小心，不要傷到自己，</p>
    <p data-start="363.86" data-end="382.88">and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't any more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar, and then--"</p>
    <p data-start="363.86" data-end="382.88">然後我會先舔一下邊緣，假裝那裡沒有更多的蜜，你知道的，然後我會走開，想一會兒，然後再回來開始舔罐子的中間，然後--」</p>
    <p data-start="383.68" data-end="410.98">"Yes, well never mind about that where you would be, and there I should catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like? I should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of-- I say, wake up, Pooh!" Pooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said that Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns.</p>
    <p data-start="383.68" data-end="410.98">「好吧，先不管你會在哪裡，然後我就會抓住你。現在首先要想的是，小象喜歡什麼？我想應該是橡果，你不覺得嗎？我們會準備很多的-- 我說，小熊維尼，醒醒！」小熊維尼沉浸在快樂的夢境中，猛然醒來，說蜂蜜比橡果更能當作誘餌。</p>
    <p data-start="412.54" data-end="436.06">Piglet didn't think so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet remembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, he would have to find the acorns, but if they put honey, then Pooh would have to give up some of his own honey, so he said, "All right, honey then," just as Pooh remembered it too, and was going to say, "All right, haycorns."</p>
    <p data-start="412.54" data-end="436.06">小豬不同意；他們正要為此爭論時，小豬想起，如果他們在陷阱裡放橡果，那他就得去找橡果，但如果他們放蜂蜜，那麼小熊維尼就得放棄一些自己的蜂蜜，所以他說：「好吧，那就放蜂蜜吧。」就在這時，小熊維尼也想到了這點，正準備說：「好吧，那就放橡果吧。」</p>
    <p data-start="437.48" data-end="473.22">"Honey," said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now settled. "I'll dig the pit, while you go and get the honey." "Very well," said Pooh, and he stumped off. As soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair, and took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY written on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and looked at it, and it looked just like honey. "But you never can tell,"</p>
    <p data-start="437.48" data-end="473.22">小豬自言自語地說：「蜂蜜，」語氣中帶著思索，好像這件事已經解決了。「我來挖坑，你去拿蜂蜜。」小熊維尼說：「好的，」然後他跺著步子走開了。他一回到家，就去了食品儲藏室；他站在椅子上，從最上面的架子上拿下一個非常大的蜂蜜罐。罐子上寫著「蜂蜜」，但為了確保，他取下紙蓋看了看，看起來確實像蜂蜜。「但你永遠說不準，」</p>
    <p data-start="473.58" data-end="483.42">said Pooh. "I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour." So he put his tongue in,</p>
    <p data-start="473.58" data-end="483.42">小熊維尼說。「我記得我叔叔有一次說過，他見過顏色跟這一樣的奶酪。」於是他伸出舌頭，</p>
    <p data-start="483.42" data-end="494.34">and took a large lick. "Yes," he said, "it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say,</p>
    <p data-start="483.42" data-end="494.34">舔了一大口。「是的，」他說，「確實是。不會錯的。我應該說，</p>
    <p data-start="494.76" data-end="501.46">right down to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course," he said,</p>
    <p data-start="494.76" data-end="501.46">罐子底部也是蜂蜜。除非，當然，」他說，</p>
    <p data-start="502.80" data-end="511.88">"somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a little further . . .</p>
    <p data-start="502.80" data-end="511.88">「有人故意在底部放了奶酪來開玩笑。也許我最好再多舔一些……</p>
    <p data-start="513.02" data-end="522.82">just in case . . . in case Heffalumps don't like cheese . . . same as me. . . . Ah!" And he gave a deep sigh.</p>
    <p data-start="513.02" data-end="522.82">以防萬一……以防小象不喜歡奶酪……就像我一樣……啊！」他深深地嘆了口氣。</p>
    <p data-start="523.98" data-end="551.60">"I was right. It is honey, right the way down." Having made certain of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet looked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said, "Got it?" and Pooh said, "Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar," and he threw it down to Piglet, and Piglet said, "No, it isn't!</p>
    <p data-start="523.98" data-end="551.60">「我說對了。罐子裡從頭到尾都是蜂蜜。」確定無誤後，他把罐子帶回給小豬，小豬從他非常深的坑底抬頭看著，說：「拿到了嗎？」小熊維尼說：「是的，但它不太滿，」然後他把罐子扔給小豬，小豬說：「確實不滿！</p>
    <p data-start="552.42" data-end="578.12">Is that all you've got left?" and Pooh said, "Yes." Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom of the Pit, and climbed out, and they went off home together. "Well, good night, Pooh," said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh's house. "And we meet at six o'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we've got in our Trap."</p>
    <p data-start="552.42" data-end="578.12">這是你剩下的全部嗎？」小熊維尼說：「是的。」因為確實是這樣。於是小豬把罐子放在坑底，爬了出來，然後他們一起回家了。「嗯，晚安，小熊維尼，」當他們走到小熊維尼的家時，小豬說。「明天早上六點我們在松樹旁見，看看我們的陷阱裡抓到了多少小象。」</p>
    <p data-start="579.48" data-end="593.22">"Six o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?" "No. Why do you want string?" "To lead them home with." "Oh! . . . I think Heffalumps come if you whistle."</p>
    <p data-start="579.48" data-end="593.22">「六點鐘，小豬。你有繩子嗎？」 「沒有。你要繩子做什麼？」 「用來牽牠們回家。」 「哦！……我想小象你只要吹口哨牠們就會跟著走。」</p>
    <p data-start="594.64" data-end="604.76">"Some do and some don't. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good night!" "Good night!"</p>
    <p data-start="594.64" data-end="604.76">「有些會有些不會。你永遠無法確定小象會怎麼做。好吧，晚安！」 「晚安！」</p>
    <p data-start="604.96" data-end="612.80">And off Piglet trotted to his house TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his preparations for bed. Some hours later,</p>
    <p data-start="604.96" data-end="612.80">然後小豬小跑著回到他寫著「侵入者 W」的家，而小熊維尼則開始準備上床睡覺。幾個小時後，</p>
    <p data-start="613.20" data-end="620.32">just as the night was beginning to steal away, Pooh woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling.</p>
    <p data-start="613.20" data-end="620.32">就在夜幕開始降臨時，小熊維尼突然醒來，心裡感到一陣沉重。</p>
    <p data-start="620.46" data-end="628.44">He had had that sinking feeling before, and he knew what it meant. He was hungry. So he went to the larder,</p>
    <p data-start="620.46" data-end="628.44">他以前也有過這種沉重的感覺，他知道這意味著什麼。他餓了。於是他走到食品儲藏室，</p>
    <p data-start="628.44" data-end="637.90">and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and found--nothing. "That's funny," he thought.</p>
    <p data-start="628.44" data-end="637.90">站在椅子上，伸手去拿最上面的架子，結果什麼也沒找到。「這真奇怪，」他想。</p>
    <p data-start="639.02" data-end="649.34">"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it,</p>
    <p data-start="639.02" data-end="649.34">「我記得我那裡有一罐蜂蜜。一整罐，滿滿的蜂蜜，直到罐子的頂端，而且上面寫著『蜂蜜』，</p>
    <p data-start="649.36" data-end="657.74">so that I should know it was honey. That's very funny." And then he began to wander up and down,</p>
    <p data-start="649.36" data-end="657.74">所以我才知道那是蜂蜜。這真是太奇怪了。” 然後他開始在屋裡走來走去，</p>
    <p data-start="657.88" data-end="665.60">wondering where it was and murmuring a murmur to himself. Like this: It's very, very funny,</p>
    <p data-start="657.88" data-end="665.60">一邊走一邊自言自語地嘟囔著。就像這樣：這真是非常非常奇怪，</p>
    <p data-start="666.18" data-end="672.08">'Cos I know I had some honey : 'Cos it had a label on, Saying HUNNY,</p>
    <p data-start="666.18" data-end="672.08">因為我知道我有一些蜂蜜：因為它有個標籤，上面寫著「蜂蜜 (HUNNY)」，</p>
    <p data-start="673.30" data-end="684.24">A goloptious full-up pot too, And I don't know where it's got to, No, I don't know where it's gone-- Well, it's funny.</p>
    <p data-start="673.30" data-end="684.24">一個滿滿的美味罐頭，而且我不知道它跑哪兒去了，對，我不知道它跑哪兒去了——真是奇怪。</p>
    <p data-start="686.18" data-end="696.74">He had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way, when suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to catch the Heffalump.</p>
    <p data-start="686.18" data-end="696.74">他這樣自言自語地哼了三遍，突然他想起來了。他把蜂蜜放進了捕捉大象 (Heffalump) 的巧妙陷阱裡。</p>
    <p data-start="697.68" data-end="721.14">"Bother!" said Pooh. "It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps." And he got back into bed. But he couldn't sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn't. He tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a good way of getting to sleep, and, as that was no good,</p>
    <p data-start="697.68" data-end="721.14">“糟了！” 小熊維尼說道。“這都是為了對大象好。” 然後他回到了床上。但他睡不著。越想睡，他越睡不著。他試著數綿羊，這有時候是一種入睡的好方法，但這次不管用，</p>
    <p data-start="721.30" data-end="748.22">he tried counting Heffalumps. And that was worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight for a pot of Pooh's honey, and eating it all. For some minutes he lay there miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump was licking its jaws, and saying to itself, "Very good honey this, I don't know when I've tasted better,"</p>
    <p data-start="721.30" data-end="748.22">於是他試著數大象。結果更糟。因為他數的每一隻大象都直奔小熊維尼的蜂蜜罐，然後把它全吃掉了。有幾分鐘他躺在那裡感到非常難過，但是當他數到第五百八十七隻大象在舔它的嘴巴，還自言自語地說：“這真是好蜂蜜，我都不記得上次吃到這麼好的蜂蜜是什麼時候了。”</p>
    <p data-start="749.44" data-end="778.22">Pooh could bear it no longer. He jumped out of bed, he ran out of the house, and he ran straight to the Six Pine Trees. The Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky over the Hundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would soon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked cold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was,</p>
    <p data-start="749.44" data-end="778.22">小熊維尼再也忍受不了了。他跳下床，跑出房子，直接奔向六棵松樹。太陽還在床上，但百畝森林的天空已經有點亮，似乎預示著它快要醒來，很快就會掀開被子。在昏暗的光線下，松樹看起來冷清而孤單，而非常深的坑看起來比實際還要深，</p>
    <p data-start="779.12" data-end="795.66">and Pooh's jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and no more. But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed honey, and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready for it.</p>
    <p data-start="779.12" data-end="795.66">而底部的小熊維尼的蜂蜜罐則顯得神秘，只能看出一個形狀。但當他靠近時，他的鼻子告訴他那確實是蜂蜜，他的舌頭伸了出來，開始舔他的嘴巴，為蜂蜜做好準備。</p>
    <p data-start="796.34" data-end="823.88">"Bother!" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. "A Heffalump has been eating it!" And then he thought a little and said, "Oh, no, I did. I forgot." Indeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very bottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to lick....</p>
    <p data-start="796.34" data-end="823.88">“糟了！” 小熊維尼說，當他的鼻子伸進罐子裡時。“有隻大象吃過它了！” 然後他想了一下說，“哦，不，是我。我忘了。” 的確，他吃掉了大部分。但罐子的最底部還剩下一點，他把頭完全伸進去，開始舔....</p>
    <p data-start="825.02" data-end="851.84">By and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke he said to himself, "Oh!" Then he said bravely, "Yes," and then, still more bravely, "Quite so." But he didn't feel very brave, for the word which was really jiggeting about in his brain was "Heffalumps." What was a Heffalump like? Was it Fierce?</p>
    <p data-start="825.02" data-end="851.84">這時小豬醒了。 他一醒來就對自己說：“哦！” 然後勇敢地說，“是的，” 然後，更加勇敢地說，“沒錯。” 但他並不感到很勇敢，因為他腦子裡真正翻來覆去的詞是“大象”。 大象是什麼樣的？它兇猛嗎？</p>
    <p data-start="853.04" data-end="865.56">Did it come when you whistled? And how did it come? Was it Fond of Pigs at all? If it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference what sort of Pig?</p>
    <p data-start="853.04" data-end="865.56">它會在你吹口哨時出現嗎？它是怎麼來的？它喜歡小豬嗎？如果它喜歡小豬，這會不會和小豬的種類有關係？</p>
    <p data-start="867.20" data-end="874.88">Supposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference if the Pig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM?</p>
    <p data-start="867.20" data-end="874.88">假如它對小豬很兇猛，那這隻小豬的祖父叫威廉 (TRESPASSERS WILLIAM) 會不會有什麼區別呢？</p>
    <p data-start="877.52" data-end="901.96">He didn't know the answer to any of these questions . . . and he was going to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now! Of course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with two. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs and Bears? Wouldn't it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn't go up to the Six Pine Trees this morning?</p>
    <p data-start="877.52" data-end="901.96">他不知道這些問題的答案……而且他大約一個小時後就要見到他的第一隻大象了！當然，小熊維尼會和他在一起，兩個人一起會更有安全感。但是假如大象對小豬和小熊都非常兇猛呢？那假裝自己頭痛，不去六棵松樹會不會更好呢？</p>
    <p data-start="903.42" data-end="925.96">But then suppose that it was a very fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he would be, in bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should he do? And then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six Pine Trees now,</p>
    <p data-start="903.42" data-end="925.96">但隨後他又想，假如今天是個大晴天，陷阱裡根本沒有大象，而他卻在床上躺了一整個早上，那他不是白白浪費時間嗎？他該怎麼辦呢？於是他有了個聰明的主意。他決定現在就悄悄地去六棵松樹那裡，</p>
    <p data-start="926.80" data-end="938.60">peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there was a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and if there wasn't, he wouldn't.</p>
    <p data-start="926.80" data-end="938.60">小心翼翼地往陷阱裡瞧一瞧，看裡面有沒有大象。如果有，他就回去睡覺，如果沒有，他就不回去。</p>
    <p data-start="940.84" data-end="947.26">So off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn't be a Heffalump in the Trap, and then he thought that there would,</p>
    <p data-start="940.84" data-end="947.26">於是他出發了。一開始他覺得陷阱裡不會有大象，然後他又覺得會有，</p>
    <p data-start="948.14" data-end="955.52">and as he got nearer he was sure that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping about it like anything.</p>
    <p data-start="948.14" data-end="955.52">當他越來越靠近時，他確信裡面會有，因為他聽到裡面傳來的聲音，像是在搞什麼事情一樣。</p>
    <p data-start="957.16" data-end="969.08">"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to run away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see what a Heffalump was like.</p>
    <p data-start="957.16" data-end="969.08">“哦，天哪，哦，天哪，哦，天哪！” 小豬自言自語道。他很想跑掉。但不知怎麼的，既然都已經這麼接近了，他覺得自己必須看看大象到底是什麼樣子。</p>
    <p data-start="970.10" data-end="983.42">So he crept to the side of the Trap and looked in. And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar off his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck.</p>
    <p data-start="970.10" data-end="983.42">於是他悄悄地爬到陷阱邊上往裡看。而此時的小熊維尼一直在努力把蜂蜜罐從他頭上取下來。他越是搖晃，罐子就越緊地卡住。</p>
    <p data-start="984.12" data-end="1013.76">"Bother!" he said, inside the jar, and "Oh, help!" and, mostly, "Ow!" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see what he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to climb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much of that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar and all,</p>
    <p data-start="984.12" data-end="1013.76">“糟了！” 他在罐子裡說，“哦，救命！” 最多的還是，“哎喲！” 他試著撞擊各種東西，但由於他看不到自己撞到了什麼，所以一點用也沒有；他試著爬出陷阱，但由於他除了罐子什麼都看不見，而且連罐子也看不清楚，他找不到路。 最後，他抬起頭，連同罐子一起，</p>
    <p data-start="1013.78" data-end="1035.14">and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair . . . and it was at that moment that Piglet looked down. "Help, help!" cried Piglet, "a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!" and he scampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, "Help, help, a Herrible Hoffalump!</p>
    <p data-start="1013.78" data-end="1035.14">發出了一聲響亮的、充滿悲傷和絕望的吼叫……就在那一刻，小豬往下看了一眼。“救命，救命！” 小豬喊道，“大象，一隻可怕的大象！” 然後他拼命地跑掉了，一邊跑一邊還喊著，“救命，救命，一隻可怕的大象！</p>
    <p data-start="1035.70" data-end="1041.22">Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a Hoffable Hellerump!"</p>
    <p data-start="1035.70" data-end="1041.22">大象，大象，一隻可怕的怪物！壞，壞，一隻可怕的怪獸！”</p>
    <p data-start="1041.86" data-end="1046.22">And he didn't stop crying and scampering until he got to Christopher Robin's house.</p>
    <p data-start="1041.86" data-end="1046.22">他一路喊著跑到了克里斯多夫·羅賓的家。</p>
    <p data-start="1048.24" data-end="1051.80">"Whatever's the matter, Piglet?" said Christopher Robin, who was just getting up.</p>
    <p data-start="1048.24" data-end="1051.80">“怎麼了，小豬？” 克里斯多夫·羅賓說，他剛剛起床。</p>
    <p data-start="1053.08" data-end="1056.82">"Heff," said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak,</p>
    <p data-start="1053.08" data-end="1056.82">“大象，” 小豬說道，氣喘吁吁，幾乎說不出話來，</p>
    <p data-start="1058.82" data-end="1060.72">"a Heff—a Heff--a Heffalump."</p>
    <p data-start="1058.82" data-end="1060.72">“一隻大象——一隻大象——一隻大象。”</p>
    <p data-start="1060.74" data-end="1071.92">"Where?" "Up there," said Piglet, waving his paw. "What did it look like?" "Like--like---- It had the biggest head you ever saw,</p>
    <p data-start="1060.74" data-end="1071.92">“在哪裡？” “在那裡，” 小豬揮著爪子說。“它長什麼樣子？” “像——像—— 它有你見過的最大的頭，</p>
    <p data-start="1072.14" data-end="1080.68">Christopher Robin. A great enormous thing, like--like nothing. A huge big--well,</p>
    <p data-start="1072.14" data-end="1080.68">克里斯多夫·羅賓。一個巨大無比的東西，像——像什麼都不像。 一個巨大的——嗯，</p>
    <p data-start="1080.98" data-end="1103.96">like a--I don't know—like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar." "Well," said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, "I shall go and look at it. Come on." Piglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they went.... "I can hear it, can't you?"</p>
    <p data-start="1080.98" data-end="1103.96">像——我不知道——像個巨大的什麼都不像的東西。像個罐子。” “嗯，” 克里斯多夫·羅賓說著，穿上了鞋，“我得去看看。來吧。” 小豬只要有克里斯多夫·羅賓在身邊就不害怕了，所以他們一起出發了…… “我能聽到它的聲音，你聽到了嗎？”</p>
    <p data-start="1104.12" data-end="1110.80">said Piglet anxiously, as they got near. "I can hear something," said Christopher Robin.</p>
    <p data-start="1104.12" data-end="1110.80">當他們靠近時，小豬焦急地說。“我聽到了一些聲音，” 克里斯多夫·羅賓說道。</p>
    <p data-start="1112.40" data-end="1120.64">It was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found. "There!" said Piglet. "Isn't it awful?"</p>
    <p data-start="1112.40" data-end="1120.64">那是小熊維尼用頭撞到一根樹根發出的聲音。“那裡！” 小豬說。“是不是很可怕？”</p>
    <p data-start="1121.54" data-end="1127.88">And he held on tight to Christopher Robin's hand. Suddenly Christopher Robin began to laugh . . .</p>
    <p data-start="1121.54" data-end="1127.88">他緊緊地抓住克里斯多夫·羅賓的手。突然，克里斯多夫·羅賓開始大笑……</p>
    <p data-start="1128.44" data-end="1137.52">and he laughed . . and he laughed . . . and he laughed. And while he was still laughing-- Crash went the Heffalump's head against the tree-root,</p>
    <p data-start="1128.44" data-end="1137.52">他笑了……他笑了……他笑了。 就在他還在笑的時候——大象的頭撞上了樹根，</p>
    <p data-start="1138.52" data-end="1152.60">Smash went the jar, and out came Pooh's head again.... Then Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a headache.</p>
    <p data-start="1138.52" data-end="1152.60">罐子碎了，小熊維尼的頭又出來了…… 這時小豬才明白自己有多麼愚蠢，他感到非常羞愧，於是直接跑回家，帶著頭痛上床睡覺去了。</p>
    <p data-start="1153.58" data-end="1169.12">But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast together. "Oh, Bear!" said Christopher Robin. "How I do love you!" "So do I," said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="1153.58" data-end="1169.12">但克里斯多夫·羅賓和小熊維尼一起回家吃早餐去了。“哦，熊啊！” 克里斯多夫·羅賓說道。“我多愛你啊！” “我也是，” 小熊維尼說。</p>
