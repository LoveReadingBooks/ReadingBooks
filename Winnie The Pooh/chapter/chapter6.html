    <p data-start="7.88" data-end="12.14">...IN WHICH EEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY AND GETS TWO PRESENTS</p>
    <p data-start="7.88" data-end="12.14">...在這一章中，屹耳過生日並收到了兩份禮物</p>
    <p data-start="14.68" data-end="20.10">EEYORE, the old grey Donkey, stood by the side of the stream, and looked at himself in the water.</p>
    <p data-start="14.68" data-end="20.10">屹耳，這隻年老的灰色驢子，站在溪邊，望著水中的自己。</p>
    <p data-start="22.48" data-end="27.98">"Pathetic," he said. s' That's what it is. Pathetic."</p>
    <p data-start="22.48" data-end="27.98">「可憐」，他說。「就是這樣。可憐。」</p>
    <p data-start="28.00" data-end="39.68">He turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards, splashed across it, and walked slowly back on the other side. Then he looked at himself in the water again.</p>
    <p data-start="28.00" data-end="39.68">他轉過身，慢慢地沿著溪流走了二十碼，然後蹚過溪流，慢慢地走回另一邊。然後他又看了看水中的自己。</p>
    <p data-start="40.22" data-end="55.04">"As I thought," he said. "No better from this side. But nobody minds. Nobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is."</p>
    <p data-start="40.22" data-end="55.04">「果然如此」，他說。「從這邊看也沒好多少。但沒人介意。沒人在乎。可憐，就是這樣。」</p>
    <p data-start="56.72" data-end="67.20">There was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him, and out came Pooh. "Good morning, Eeyore," said Pooh. "Good morning, Pooh Bear,"</p>
    <p data-start="56.72" data-end="67.20">這時，身後的蕨叢裡傳來沙沙聲，然後小熊維尼走了出來。「早安，屹耳」，小熊維尼說。「早安，小熊維尼，」</p>
    <p data-start="67.78" data-end="85.30">said Eeyore gloomily. "If it is a good morning," he said. "Which I doubt," said he. "Why, what's the matter?" "Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can't all,</p>
    <p data-start="67.78" data-end="85.30">屹耳憂鬱地說。「如果這真是個早安的話，」他說。「我懷疑，」他又說。「怎麼了，出了什麼事嗎？」「沒什麼，小熊維尼，沒什麼。我們無法都這樣，</p>
    <p data-start="85.32" data-end="115.04">and some of us don't. That's all there is to it." "Can't all what?" said Pooh, rubbing his nose. "Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush." "Oh!" said Pooh. He thought for a long time, and then asked, "What mulberry bush is that?" "Bon-hommy," went on Eeyore gloomily.</p>
    <p data-start="85.32" data-end="115.04">而有些人並不這樣。事情就是這樣。」 「不能都怎樣？」小熊維尼揉著鼻子問。「快樂。歌舞。圍著桑樹叢轉圈圈。」 「哦！」 小熊維尼說。他思考了很久，然後問道，「是哪一叢桑樹呢？」 「和藹可親，」屹耳憂鬱地接著說。</p>
    <p data-start="116.46" data-end="142.72">"French word meaning bonhommy," he explained. "I'm not complaining, but There It Is." Pooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think this out. It sounded to him like a riddle, and he was never much good at riddles, being a Bear of Very Little Brain. So he sang Cottleston Pie instead:</p>
    <p data-start="116.46" data-end="142.72">「法語裡的‘和藹可親’」，他解釋道。「我不是在抱怨，但就是這樣。」 小熊維尼坐在一塊大石頭上，試圖理清這個問題。對他來說，這聽起來像個謎語，而他從來不擅長解謎，因為他是一隻頭腦簡單的小熊。所以他改唱《科特斯頓派》：</p>
    <p data-start="143.32" data-end="160.30">Cottleslon, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie. A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly. Ask me a riddle and I reply: "Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie."</p>
    <p data-start="143.32" data-end="160.30">科特斯頓，科特斯頓，科特斯頓派。一隻蒼蠅不能鳥，但鳥能飛。問我一個謎語，我會回答：「科特斯頓，科特斯頓，科特斯頓派。」</p>
    <p data-start="161.98" data-end="171.72">That was the first verse. When he had finished it, Eeyore didn't actually say that he didn't like it, so Pooh very kindly sang the second verse to him:</p>
    <p data-start="161.98" data-end="171.72">這是第一節。當他唱完後，屹耳並沒有表示不喜歡，所以小熊維尼很友好地唱了第二節給他聽：</p>
    <p data-start="173.58" data-end="201.28">Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie, A fish can't whistle and neither can I. Ask me a riddle and I reply: "Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie." Eeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed the third verse quietly to himself: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,</p>
    <p data-start="173.58" data-end="201.28">科特斯頓，科特斯頓，科特斯頓派，一條魚不能吹口哨，我也不能。問我一個謎語，我會回答：「科特斯頓，科特斯頓，科特斯頓派。」 屹耳依然一言不發，所以小熊維尼輕輕地對自己哼唱了第三節： 科特斯頓，科特斯頓，科特斯頓派，</p>
    <p data-start="201.84" data-end="215.88">Why does a chicken, I don't know why. Ask me a riddle and I reply: "Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie." "That's right,"</p>
    <p data-start="201.84" data-end="215.88">為什麼雞會這樣，我不知道為什麼。問我一個謎語，我會回答：「科特斯頓，科特斯頓，科特斯頓派。」 「沒錯，」</p>
    <p data-start="216.52" data-end="229.34">said Eeyore. "Sing. Umty-tiddly, umty-too. Here we go gathering Nuts and May. Enjoy yourself."</p>
    <p data-start="216.52" data-end="229.34">屹耳說。「唱吧。‘Umty-tiddly, umty-too’。我們去收集堅果和五月花。享受吧。」</p>
    <p data-start="231.16" data-end="241.90">"I am," said Pooh. "Some can," said Eeyore. "Why, what's the matter?" "Is anything the matter?"</p>
    <p data-start="231.16" data-end="241.90">「我在享受，」小熊維尼說。「有些人可以，」屹耳說。「怎麼了，出了什麼事？」 「有什麼事嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="243.22" data-end="261.32">"You seem so sad, Eeyore." "Sad? Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the year." "Your birthday?" said Pooh in great surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="243.22" data-end="261.32">「你看起來很悲傷，屹耳。」 「悲傷？我為什麼要悲傷？今天是我的生日。一年中最快樂的一天。」 「你的生日？」小熊維尼非常驚訝地說。</p>
    <p data-start="262.92" data-end="274.18">"Of course it is. Can't you see? Look at all the presents I have had." He waved a foot from side to side.</p>
    <p data-start="262.92" data-end="274.18">「當然是。你沒看見嗎？看看我收到的所有禮物。」他把一隻腳左右晃了晃。</p>
    <p data-start="275.80" data-end="284.60">"Look at the birthday cake. Candles and pink sugar." Pooh looked--first to the right and then to the left.</p>
    <p data-start="275.80" data-end="284.60">「看看生日蛋糕。蠟燭和粉紅色的糖。」 小熊維尼先向右看了看，然後向左看了看。</p>
    <p data-start="285.68" data-end="312.26">"Presents?" said Pooh. "Birthday cake?" said Pooh. "Where?" "Can't you see them?" "No," said Pooh. "Neither can I," said Eeyore. "Joke," he explained. "Ha ha!" Pooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this.</p>
    <p data-start="285.68" data-end="312.26">「禮物？」小熊維尼說。「生日蛋糕？」小熊維尼說。「在哪裡？」 「你沒看見嗎？」 「沒有，」小熊維尼說。 「我也沒看見，」屹耳說。「開玩笑的，」他解釋道。「哈哈！」 小熊維尼抓了抓頭，對這一切感到有點困惑。</p>
    <p data-start="313.84" data-end="332.30">"But is it really your birthday?" he asked. "It is." "Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day, Eeyore." "And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear."</p>
    <p data-start="313.84" data-end="332.30">「但今天真的是你的生日嗎？」他問。「是的。」 「哦！那麼，祝你生日快樂，屹耳。」 「也祝你生日快樂，小熊維尼。」</p>
    <p data-start="333.66" data-end="360.34">"But it isn't my birthday." "No, it's mine." "But you said 'Many happy returns'--" "Well, why not? You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday, do you?" "Oh, I see," said Pooh. "It's bad enough." said Eeyore. almost breaking down</p>
    <p data-start="333.66" data-end="360.34">「但今天不是我的生日。」 「不，是我的。」 「但你說『生日快樂』——」 「嗯，為什麼不呢？你不會總是在我生日的時候感到悲慘吧？」 「哦，我明白了，」小熊維尼說。「我自己都夠悲慘的了，」屹耳說，幾乎要崩潰了，</p>
    <p data-start="361.40" data-end="374.18">"being miserable myself, what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper notice taken of me at all,</p>
    <p data-start="361.40" data-end="374.18">「自己已經這麼悲慘，沒有禮物，沒有蛋糕，沒有蠟燭，根本沒有人注意到我，</p>
    <p data-start="375.16" data-end="385.00">but if everybody else is going to be miserable too----" This was too much for Pooh. "Stay there!" he called to Eeyore,</p>
    <p data-start="375.16" data-end="385.00">但如果其他人也要變得悲慘的話——」 小熊維尼再也受不了了。「待在那裡！」他對屹耳喊道，</p>
    <p data-start="385.08" data-end="414.24">as he turned and hurried back home as quick as he could; for he felt that he must get poor Eeyore a present of some sort at once, and he could always think of a proper one afterwards. Outside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach the knocker. "Hallo, Piglet," he said. "Hallo, Pooh," said Piglet. "What are you trying to do?" "I was trying to reach the knocker," said Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="385.08" data-end="414.24">然後轉身盡快跑回家，因為他覺得必須立刻給可憐的屹耳買一份禮物，至於什麼樣的禮物可以稍後再想。在他的房子外面，他發現小豬正跳上跳下，試圖夠到門環。「你好，小豬，」他說。「你好，小熊維尼，」小豬說。「你在幹什麼？」 「我在試著夠到門環，」小豬說。</p>
    <p data-start="414.64" data-end="444.50">"I just came round----" "Let me do it for you," said Pooh kindly. So he reached up and knocked at the door. "I have just seen Eeyore is in a Very Sad Condition, because it's his birthday, and nobody has taken any notice of it, and he's very Gloomy--you know what Eeyore is--and there he was, and----</p>
    <p data-start="414.64" data-end="444.50">「我剛剛路過——」「讓我來幫你吧，」小熊維尼友好地說。於是他伸手敲了敲門。「我剛看到屹耳非常悲傷，因為今天是他的生日，沒有人注意到他，他非常憂鬱——你知道屹耳是怎麼樣的——然後他就在那裡，——</p>
    <p data-start="444.56" data-end="474.52">What a long time whoever lives here is answering this door." And he knocked again. "But Pooh," said Piglet, "it's your own house!" "Oh!" said Pooh. "So it is," he said. "Well, let's go in." So in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to see if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it down. "I'm giving this to Eeyore,"</p>
    <p data-start="444.56" data-end="474.52">不管住在這裡的人花這麼長時間才應門是怎麼回事。」他又敲了敲門。「但是小熊維尼，」小豬說，「這是你自己的家！」 「哦！」小熊維尼說。「原來是這樣，」他說。「那我們進去吧。」於是他們進去了。小熊維尼做的第一件事就是走到櫥櫃前，看看他是否還有一小罐蜂蜜剩下；果然有，所以他拿了下來。「我要把這個送給屹耳，」</p>
    <p data-start="474.56" data-end="503.54">he explained, "as a present. What are you going to give?" "Couldn't I give it too?" said Piglet. "From both of us?" "No," said Pooh. "That would not be a good plan." "All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my party. I'll go and get it now, shall I?" "That, Piglet, is a very good idea.</p>
    <p data-start="474.56" data-end="503.54">他解釋道，「作為禮物。你打算送什麼？」 「我也可以送這個嗎？」小豬說。「我們兩個一起送？」 「不，」小熊維尼說。「那不是個好主意。」 「好吧，那我送他一個氣球。我從派對上剩下了一個。我現在去拿，好嗎？」 「那是個好主意，小豬，</p>
    <p data-start="503.56" data-end="512.20">It is just what Eeyore wants to cheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon."</p>
    <p data-start="503.56" data-end="512.20">這正是屹耳想要的，能讓他高興起來。沒有人會因為有了氣球還感到不開心。」</p>
    <p data-start="512.24" data-end="519.22">So off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his jar of honey. It was a warm day,</p>
    <p data-start="512.24" data-end="519.22">於是小豬小跑著離開了；小熊維尼則拿著他的蜂蜜罐朝另一個方向走去。那是一個溫暖的日子，</p>
    <p data-start="519.22" data-end="525.92">and he had a long way to go. He hadn't gone more than half-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him.</p>
    <p data-start="519.22" data-end="525.92">他有很長的一段路要走。他走了還不到一半時，身體開始有一種奇怪的感覺蔓延開來。</p>
    <p data-start="525.92" data-end="532.98">It began at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the soles of his feet.</p>
    <p data-start="525.92" data-end="532.98">這種感覺從他的鼻尖開始，流遍全身，然後從腳底流了出去。</p>
    <p data-start="533.18" data-end="541.90">It was just as if somebody inside him were saying, "Now then, Pooh, time for a little something."</p>
    <p data-start="533.18" data-end="541.90">就像是他體內的某個人在說：「好了，小熊維尼，該吃點東西了。」</p>
    <p data-start="543.68" data-end="552.32">"Dear, dear," said Pooh, "I didn't know it was as late as that." So he sat down and took the top off his jar of honey.</p>
    <p data-start="543.68" data-end="552.32">「天哪，天哪，」小熊維尼說，「我不知道已經這麼晚了。」 於是他坐下來，打開了他的蜂蜜罐。</p>
    <p data-start="553.78" data-end="562.50">"Lucky I brought this with me," he thought. "Many a bear going out on a warm day like this would never have thought of bringing a little something with him."</p>
    <p data-start="553.78" data-end="562.50">「幸好我帶了這個來。」他想。「很多熊在這樣的溫暖天氣裡出門，都不會想到帶點吃的。」</p>
    <p data-start="562.66" data-end="576.30">And he began to eat. "Now let me see," he thought! as he took his last lick of the inside of the jar,</p>
    <p data-start="562.66" data-end="576.30">於是他開始吃了起來。「現在讓我想想，」他在舔了舔罐子的最後一口時想到，</p>
    <p data-start="576.54" data-end="590.12">"Where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore." He got up slowly. And then, suddenly, he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore's birthday present!</p>
    <p data-start="576.54" data-end="590.12">「我剛剛要去哪裡來著？啊，是的，屹耳。」他慢慢地站了起來。然後，突然間，他想起來了。他吃掉了屹耳的生日禮物！</p>
    <p data-start="590.38" data-end="620.26">"Bother!" said Pooh. "What shall I do? I must give him something." For a little while he couldn't think of anything. Then he thought: "Well, it's a very nice pot, even if there's no honey in it, and if I washed it clean, and got somebody to write 'A Happy Birthday' on it,</p>
    <p data-start="590.38" data-end="620.26">「糟了！」小熊維尼說。「我該怎麼辦？我一定要送他些什麼。」他一時之間想不出任何東西。然後他想到：「嗯，這個罐子還是很不錯的，即使裡面沒有蜂蜜，如果我把它洗乾淨，然後找人幫我在上面寫『生日快樂』，</p>
    <p data-start="620.84" data-end="630.58">Eeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful." So, as he was just passing the Hundred Acre Wood,</p>
    <p data-start="620.84" data-end="630.58">屹耳可以用它來裝東西，這可能會很有用。」於是，當他正經過百畝森林時，</p>
    <p data-start="630.58" data-end="642.34">he went inside to call on Owl, who lived there. "Good morning, Owl," he said. "Good morning, Pooh," said Owl.</p>
    <p data-start="630.58" data-end="642.34">他走進去拜訪住在那裡的貓頭鷹。「早安，貓頭鷹，」他說。「早安，小熊維尼，」貓頭鷹說。</p>
    <p data-start="642.36" data-end="653.00">"Many happy returns of Eeyore's birthday," said Pooh. "Oh, is that what it is?" "What are you giving him, Owl?" "What are you giving him, Pooh?"</p>
    <p data-start="642.36" data-end="653.00">「祝屹耳生日快樂，」小熊維尼說。「哦，原來是這樣啊？」 「你打算送他什麼，貓頭鷹？」 「那你打算送他什麼呢，小熊維尼？」</p>
    <p data-start="653.56" data-end="666.24">"I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wanted to ask you " "Is this it?" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh's paw.</p>
    <p data-start="653.56" data-end="666.24">「我打算送他一個可以裝東西的有用罐子，我想問你……」「這是它嗎？」貓頭鷹從小熊維尼的爪子裡拿了過來。</p>
    <p data-start="666.54" data-end="696.28">"Yes, and I wanted to ask you--" "Somebody has been keeping honey in it," said Owl. "You can keep anything in it," said Pooh earnestly. "It's Very Useful like that. And I wanted to ask you----" "You ought to write 'A Happy Birthday' on it." "That was what I wanted to ask you," said Pooh." Because my spelling is Wobbly. It's good spelling but it Wobbles,</p>
    <p data-start="666.54" data-end="696.28">「是的，我想問你——」「有人把蜂蜜裝在裡面了，」貓頭鷹說。「你可以裝任何東西，」小熊維尼認真地說。「它非常有用。而我想問你……」「你應該在上面寫『生日快樂』。」 「這正是我想問你的，」小熊維尼說。「因為我的拼字很搖晃。拼得不錯，但它會搖晃，</p>
    <p data-start="696.54" data-end="711.60">and the letters get in the wrong places. Would you write 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?" "It's a nice pot," said Owl, looking at it all round.</p>
    <p data-start="696.54" data-end="711.60">字母會跑到錯誤的位置。你能幫我在上面寫『生日快樂』嗎？」 「這是一個不錯的罐子，」貓頭鷹一邊看著它一邊說。</p>
    <p data-start="712.70" data-end="721.34">"Couldn't I give it too? From both of us?" "No," said Pooh. "That would not be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it first, and then you can write on it."</p>
    <p data-start="712.70" data-end="721.34">「我不能也送它嗎？我們倆一起送？」 「不行，」小熊維尼說。「這不是個好主意。現在我先把它洗乾淨，然後你可以在上面寫字。」</p>
    <p data-start="725.14" data-end="743.88">Well, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while Owl licked the end of his pencil, and wondered how to spell "birthday." "Can you read, Pooh?" he asked a little anxiously. "There's a notice about knocking and ringing outside my door, which Christopher Robin wrote. Could you read it?"</p>
    <p data-start="725.14" data-end="743.88">於是他把罐子洗乾淨並擦乾，當貓頭鷹舔著他的鉛筆頭，思考該如何拼寫「生日」時，他有點焦急地問：「你能讀字嗎，小熊維尼？」 「克里斯多夫·羅賓在我門外貼了一個關於敲門和按鈴的告示，是他寫的。你能讀嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="744.70" data-end="758.56">"Christopher Robin told me what it said, and then I could." "Well, I'll tell you what this says, and then you'll be able to." So Owl wrote . . . and this is what he wrote:</p>
    <p data-start="744.70" data-end="758.56">「克里斯多夫·羅賓告訴我上面寫的是什麼，然後我就能讀了。」 「好吧，我告訴你這個寫了什麼，然後你就能讀了。」於是貓頭鷹開始寫……這就是他寫的： </p>
    <p data-start="758.96" data-end="772.88">HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY. Pooh looked on admiringly. "I'm just saying 'A Happy Birthday',"</p>
    <p data-start="758.96" data-end="772.88">HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY。小熊維尼羨慕地看著。「我只是在說『生日快樂』，」</p>
    <p data-start="773.40" data-end="785.66">said Owl carelessly. "It's a nice long one," said Pooh, very much impressed by it. "Well, actually, of course, I'm saying 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh.'</p>
    <p data-start="773.40" data-end="785.66">貓頭鷹漫不經心地說。「這真是一個很長的祝福，」小熊維尼對此非常印象深刻。「嗯，事實上，當然，我是在說『非常生日快樂，並附上小熊維尼的愛意。』」</p>
    <p data-start="786.08" data-end="793.58">Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long thing like that." "Oh, I see,"</p>
    <p data-start="786.08" data-end="793.58">「當然，寫這麼長的東西需要不少鉛筆。」 「哦，我明白了，」</p>
    <p data-start="793.98" data-end="801.08">said Pooh. While all this was happening, Piglet had gone back to his own house to get Eeyore's balloon.</p>
    <p data-start="793.98" data-end="801.08">小熊維尼說。 當這一切發生時，小豬已經回到自己的家去取屹耳的氣球了。</p>
    <p data-start="802.12" data-end="810.52">He held it very tightly against himself, so that it shouldn't blow away, and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to Eeyore before Pooh did;</p>
    <p data-start="802.12" data-end="810.52">他把氣球緊緊地抱在胸前，這樣它就不會被風吹走，然後他盡可能快地跑去找屹耳，</p>
    <p data-start="811.22" data-end="818.20">for he thought that he would like to be the first one to give a present, just as if he had thought of it without being told by anybody.</p>
    <p data-start="811.22" data-end="818.20">因為他想成為第一個送禮物的人，好像是他自己想到這個主意的，沒有人告訴他一樣。</p>
    <p data-start="819.82" data-end="835.08">And running along, and thinking how pleased Eeyore would be, he didn't look where he was going . . . and suddenly he put his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face. BANG!!!???***!!!</p>
    <p data-start="819.82" data-end="835.08">他一邊跑一邊想著屹耳會多麼高興，卻沒有注意到自己正跑向哪裡……突然間，他的腳踩進了一個兔子洞，然後整個人摔了下去，臉朝下。砰！！！？？？***！！！</p>
    <p data-start="835.94" data-end="865.66">Piglet lay there, wondering what had happened. At first he thought that the whole world had blown up; and then he thought that perhaps only the Forest part of it had; and then he thought that perhaps only he had, and he was now alone in the moon or somewhere, and would never see Christopher Robin or Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought, "Well, even if I'm in the moon, I needn't be face downwards all the time," so he got cautiously up and looked about him.</p>
    <p data-start="835.94" data-end="865.66">小豬躺在那裡，想知道發生了什麼事。一開始他以為整個世界都爆炸了；然後他想也許只是森林的一部分爆炸了；接著他又覺得可能只是他自己爆炸了，他現在獨自一人在月球或某個地方，再也見不到克里斯多夫·羅賓、小熊維尼或屹耳了。然後他想：「嗯，即使我在月球上，我也不必一直面朝下。」所以他小心翼翼地站起來，四處看了看。</p>
    <p data-start="868.98" data-end="892.70">He was still in the Forest! "Well, that's funny," he thought. "I wonder what that bang was. I couldn't have made such a noise just falling down. And where's my balloon? And what's that small piece of damp rag doing?" It was the balloon! "Oh, dear!" said Piglet. "Oh, dear, oh, dearie, dearie, dear!</p>
    <p data-start="868.98" data-end="892.70">他還在森林裡！「這真是奇怪，」他想。「我不知道那聲巨響是什麼。我光是摔倒不可能發出那麼大的聲音。我的氣球呢？那塊小小的濕布條是怎麼回事？」那是氣球！「哦，天哪！」小豬說。「哦，天哪，天哪，真是倒楣透了！」</p>
    <p data-start="893.60" data-end="914.68">Well, it's too late now. I can't go back, and I haven't another balloon, and perhaps Eeyore doesn't like balloons so very much." So he trotted on, rather sadly now, and down he came to the side of the stream where Eeyore was, and called out to him. "Good morning, Eeyore,"</p>
    <p data-start="893.60" data-end="914.68">「現在已經太晚了。我不能回去，也沒有其他氣球了，也許屹耳並不那麼喜歡氣球。」於是他繼續有點悲傷地往前走，最後來到了溪邊，屹耳就在那裡，他向屹耳喊道：「早安，屹耳。」</p>
    <p data-start="914.72" data-end="944.44">shouted Piglet. "Good morning, Little Piglet," said Eeyore. "If it is a good morning," he said. "Which I doubt," said he. "Not that it matters," he said. "Many happy returns of the day," said Piglet, having now got closer. Eeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream, and turned to stare at Piglet. "Just say that again," he said. "Many hap--"</p>
    <p data-start="914.72" data-end="944.44">小豬大聲喊道。「早安，小豬，」屹耳說。「如果真的是個好早晨的話，」他說。「不過我懷疑，」他說。「不過這不重要，」他說。「祝你今天快樂，」小豬說，現在他已經走得更近了。屹耳停止了看著溪水中的自己，轉身盯著小豬。「再說一遍，」他說。「祝你今天快樂——」</p>
    <p data-start="944.92" data-end="974.60">"Wait a moment." Balancing on three legs, he began to bring his fourth leg very cautiously up to his ear. "I did this yesterday," he explained, as he fell down for the third time. "It's quite easy. It's so as I can hear better. ... There, that's done it! Now then, what were you saying?" He pushed his ear forward with his hoof.</p>
    <p data-start="944.92" data-end="974.60">「等一下。」屹耳平衡在三條腿上，開始小心翼翼地將第四條腿抬到耳邊。「我昨天也是這麼做的，」他解釋道，然後第三次摔倒了。「這很簡單。這樣我可以聽得更清楚……好了，搞定了！那麼，你剛剛說什麼？」他用蹄子將耳朵推向前。</p>
    <p data-start="974.72" data-end="1004.50">"Many happy returns of the day," said Piglet again. "Meaning me?" "Of course, Eeyore." "My birthday?" "Yes." "Me having a real birthday?" "Yes, Eeyore, and I've brought you a present." Eeyore took down his right hoof from his right ear, turned round, and with great difficulty put up his left hoof.</p>
    <p data-start="974.72" data-end="1004.50">「祝你今天快樂，」小豬又說了一遍。「指的是我嗎？」 「當然了，屹耳。」 「我的生日？」 「是的。」 「我真的有生日嗎？」 「是的，屹耳，我還給你帶來了一份禮物。」屹耳將右蹄從右耳上放下來，轉過身，費了好大的勁才將左蹄抬起來。</p>
    <p data-start="1004.54" data-end="1018.66">"I must have that in the other ear," he said. "Now then." "A present," said Piglet very loudly.</p>
    <p data-start="1004.54" data-end="1018.66">「我得用另一隻耳朵聽聽，」他說。「那麼，說吧。」 「一份禮物，」小豬非常大聲地說。</p>
    <p data-start="1019.36" data-end="1034.24">"Meaning me again?" "Yes." "My birthday still?" "Of course, Eeyore." "Me going on having a real birthday?"</p>
    <p data-start="1019.36" data-end="1034.24">「又是指我？」 「是的。」 「還是我的生日？」 「當然了，屹耳。」 「我還有生日可以過？」</p>
    <p data-start="1034.30" data-end="1048.16">"Yes, Eeyore, and I brought you a balloon." "Balloon?" said Eeyore. "You did say balloon? One of those big coloured things you blow up?</p>
    <p data-start="1034.30" data-end="1048.16">「是的，屹耳，而且我帶來了氣球給你。」 「氣球？」屹耳說。「你說的是氣球嗎？就是那種可以吹起來的大彩色東西？」</p>
    <p data-start="1048.30" data-end="1064.44">Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and there we are?" "Yes, but I'm afraid--I'm very sorry, Eeyore-- but when I was running along to bring it you, I fell down."</p>
    <p data-start="1048.30" data-end="1064.44">「歡樂、歌舞、來來回回？」 「是的，但是我很抱歉——我真的很抱歉，屹耳——當我跑來給你送氣球的時候，我摔倒了。」</p>
    <p data-start="1065.82" data-end="1092.40">"Dear, dear, how unlucky! You ran too fast, I expect. You didn't hurt yourself, Little Piglet?" "No, but I--I--oh, Eeyore, I burst the balloon!" There was a very long silence. "My balloon?" said Eeyore at last. Piglet nodded.</p>
    <p data-start="1065.82" data-end="1092.40">「唉，真倒霉！我猜是你跑得太快了。你沒有受傷吧，小豬？」 「沒有，但是我——我——哦，屹耳，我把氣球弄破了！」接著是一段非常長的沉默。「我的氣球？」屹耳終於說道。小豬點了點頭。</p>
    <p data-start="1093.62" data-end="1113.30">"My birthday balloon?" "Yes, Eeyore," said Piglet sniffing a little. "Here it is. With--with many happy returns of the day." And he gave Eeyore the small piece of damp rag. "Is this it?"</p>
    <p data-start="1093.62" data-end="1113.30">「我生日的氣球？」 「是的，屹耳，」小豬抽泣著說。「它就在這裡，祝你生日快樂。」然後他把那塊小小的濕布條遞給屹耳。「這就是？」</p>
    <p data-start="1113.92" data-end="1142.60">said Eeyore, a little surprised. Piglet nodded. "My present?" Piglet nodded again. "The balloon?" "Yes." "Thank you, Piglet," said Eeyore. "You don't mind my asking," he went on, "but what colour was this balloon when it--when it was a balloon?"</p>
    <p data-start="1113.92" data-end="1142.60">屹耳有點驚訝地說。小豬點了點頭。「我的禮物？」小豬再次點了點頭。「那個氣球？」 「是的。」 「謝謝你，小豬，」屹耳說。「你不介意我問問，這個氣球原來是什麼顏色的，當它還是個氣球的時候？」</p>
    <p data-start="1143.70" data-end="1171.68">"Red." "I just wondered. ... Red," he murmured to himself. "My favourite colour. ... How big was it?" "About as big as me." "I just wondered. ... About as big as Piglet," he said to himself sadly. "My favourite size. Well, well."</p>
    <p data-start="1143.70" data-end="1171.68">「紅色的。」 「我只是想知道……紅色的，」他自言自語道。「我最喜歡的顏色……有多大？」 「大概和我一樣大。」 「我只是想知道……大約和小豬一樣大，」他悲傷地自言自語道。「我最喜歡的大小。唉，唉。」</p>
    <p data-start="1172.06" data-end="1187.34">Piglet felt very miserable, and didn't know what to say. He was still opening his mouth to begin something, and then deciding that it wasn't any good saying that, when he heard a shout from the other side of the river, and there was Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="1172.06" data-end="1187.34">小豬感到非常難過，不知道該說什麼。他張開嘴想說些什麼，然後又決定沒必要說，這時他聽到河對岸傳來一聲喊叫，是小熊維尼。</p>
    <p data-start="1188.50" data-end="1216.68">"Many happy returns of the day," called out Pooh, forgetting that he had said it already. "Thank you, Pooh, I'm having them," said Eeyore gloomily. "I've brought you a little present," said Pooh excitedly. "I've had it," said Eeyore. Pooh had now splashed across the stream to Eeyore, and Piglet was sitting a little way off, his head in his paws, snuffling to himself.</p>
    <p data-start="1188.50" data-end="1216.68">「祝你今天快樂，」小熊維尼喊道，忘記了他已經說過一次了。「謝謝你，小熊維尼，我正在過呢，」屹耳陰鬱地說。「我給你帶來了一份小禮物，」小熊維尼興奮地說。「我已經收到了，」屹耳說。小熊維尼現在已經蹚過小溪來到了屹耳身邊，而小豬則坐在不遠處，頭埋在爪子裡，低聲抽泣著。</p>
    <p data-start="1217.56" data-end="1236.42">"It's a Useful Pot," said Pooh. "Here it is. And it's got 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh' written on it. That's what all that writing is. And it's for putting things in. There!" When Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited.</p>
    <p data-start="1217.56" data-end="1236.42">「這是一個有用的罐子，」小熊維尼說。「這就是，而且上面還寫著『祝你非常快樂的生日，附上小熊維尼的愛』。這就是所有這些字母的意思。這是用來裝東西的。看吧！」當屹耳看到罐子時，他變得非常興奮。</p>
    <p data-start="1237.46" data-end="1257.94">"Why!" he said. "I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!" "Oh, no, Eeyore," said Pooh. "Balloons are much too big to go into Pots. What you do with a balloon is, you hold the balloon " "Not mine,"</p>
    <p data-start="1237.46" data-end="1257.94">「為什麼！」他說。「我相信我的氣球正好可以放進這個罐子裡！」 「哦，不，屹耳，」小熊維尼說。「氣球太大了，裝不進罐子裡。你應該拿著氣球……」 「我的氣球不是，」</p>
    <p data-start="1258.74" data-end="1283.34">said Eeyore proudly. "Look, Piglet!" And as Piglet looked sorrowfully round, Eeyore picked the balloon up with his teeth, and placed it carefully in the pot; picked it out and put it on the ground; and then picked it up again and put it carefully back. "So it does!" said Pooh. "It goes in!" "So it does!" said Piglet. "And it comes out!"</p>
    <p data-start="1258.74" data-end="1283.34">屹耳驕傲地說。「看，小豬！」當小豬哀傷地看過去時，屹耳用牙齒撿起氣球，小心翼翼地放進罐子裡；然後又拿出來放在地上；再撿起來小心翼翼地放回去。「它真的進去了！」小熊維尼說。「它真的進去了！」小豬說。「而且還能拿出來！」</p>
    <p data-start="1284.60" data-end="1313.40">"Doesn't it?" said Eeyore. "It goes in and out like anything." "I'm very glad," said Pooh happily, "that I thought of giving you a Useful Pot to put things in." "I'm very glad," said Piglet happily, "that thought of giving you something to put in a Useful Pot." But Eeyore wasn't listening. He was taking the balloon out, and putting it back again,</p>
    <p data-start="1284.60" data-end="1313.40">「對吧？」屹耳說。「它可以像什麼都沒發生一樣進進出出。」 「我很高興，」小熊維尼快樂地說，「我想到要送你一個有用的罐子來裝東西。」 「我也很高興，」小豬快樂地說，「我想到要送你一些可以放進有用罐子的東西。」 但是屹耳沒有在聽。他正在把氣球拿出來，又放回去，</p>
    <p data-start="1313.50" data-end="1343.36">as happy as could be.... "And didn't I give him anything?" asked Christopher Robin sadly. "Of course you did," I said. "You gave him don't you remember--a little—a little " "I gave him a box of paints to paint things with." "That was it." "Why didn't I give it to him in the morning?" "You were so busy getting his party ready for him. He had a cake with icing on the top,</p>
    <p data-start="1313.50" data-end="1343.36">他快樂得不得了……「那我沒送他什麼東西嗎？」克里斯多夫·羅賓傷心地問。「當然有，」我說。「你送了他，難道你不記得了——一個小小的——一個小小的——」「我送了他一盒顏料，用來畫畫的。」 「對，就是那個。」 「為什麼我早上沒有給他呢？」 「因為你忙著為他準備生日派對。他有一個上面有糖霜的蛋糕，</p>
    <p data-start="1343.42" data-end="1352.02">and three candles, and his name in pink sugar? and" "Yes, I remember," said Christopher Robin?</p>
    <p data-start="1343.42" data-end="1352.02">還有三根蠟燭，還有用粉紅色糖寫的他的名字？還有……」 「是的，我記得了，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說。</p>
