    <p data-start="0.46" data-end="7.48" style="margin-left: 35%;">第四章</p>
    <p data-start="9.14" data-end="14.22">...IN WHICH EEYORE LOSES A TAIL AND POOH FINDS ONE</p>
    <p data-start="9.14" data-end="14.22">...在這一章中，小驢子伊爾失去了尾巴，而小熊維尼找到了尾巴</p>
    <p data-start="18.56" data-end="23.98">The Old Grey Donkey, Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest,</p>
    <p data-start="18.56" data-end="23.98">灰色老驢子伊爾獨自站在森林中的一個滿是牛蒡的角落，</p>
    <p data-start="24.76" data-end="34.84">his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought about things. Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, "Why?" and sometimes he thought, "Wherefore?"</p>
    <p data-start="24.76" data-end="34.84">前蹄分開，頭微微歪向一邊，思索著一些事情。有時他悲傷地自言自語道，「為什麼？」有時他想，「為何？」</p>
    <p data-start="35.74" data-end="48.98">and sometimes he thought, "Inasmuch as which?"—and sometimes he didn't quite know what he was thinking about.</p>
    <p data-start="35.74" data-end="48.98">有時他會想，「因為哪個？」——有時他甚至不知道自己在想什麼。</p>
    <p data-start="50.02" data-end="68.76">So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to say "How do you do?" in a gloomy manner to him.</p>
    <p data-start="50.02" data-end="68.76">所以當小熊維尼咚咚地走來時，伊爾非常高興能夠暫時停止思考，陰沉地對他說「你好」。</p>
    <p data-start="69.08" data-end="94.76">"Not very how," he said. "I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time."</p>
    <p data-start="69.08" data-end="94.76">「不好怎麼樣，」他說。「我已經很久沒有感覺到什麼叫做好。」</p>
    <p data-start="96.24" data-end="100.76">"Why, what's happened to your tail?" he said in surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="96.24" data-end="100.76">「怎麼了，你的尾巴怎麼了？」他驚訝地問。</p>
    <p data-start="101.84" data-end="112.60">"What has happened to it?" said Eeyore.</p>
    <p data-start="101.84" data-end="112.60">「我的尾巴怎麼了？」伊爾說。</p>
    <p data-start="113.26" data-end="122.08">You can't make a mistake about it. And yours isn't there!"</p>
    <p data-start="113.26" data-end="122.08">「你不能搞錯的。你的尾巴不見了！」</p>
    <p data-start="123.00" data-end="152.90">"Nothing."</p>
    <p data-start="123.00" data-end="152.90">「沒什麼。」</p>
    <p data-start="153.00" data-end="182.96">"Of course I'm right," said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="153.00" data-end="182.96">「我當然是對的，」小熊維尼說。</p>
    <p data-start="183.00" data-end="193.36">Pooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn't quite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.</p>
    <p data-start="183.00" data-end="193.36">小熊維尼覺得自己應該說些有幫助的話，但不太知道該說什麼。於是他決定改做些有幫助的事情。</p>
    <p data-start="195.02" data-end="207.84">"Eeyore," he said solemnly, "I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you."</p>
    <p data-start="195.02" data-end="207.84">「伊爾，」他嚴肅地說，「我，小熊維尼，會幫你找到你的尾巴。」</p>
    <p data-start="208.86" data-end="219.04">"You're a real friend," said he. "Not like Some," he said.</p>
    <p data-start="208.86" data-end="219.04">「你真是個真正的朋友，」伊爾說。「不像有些人，」他說。</p>
    <p data-start="219.28" data-end="226.42">It was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky,</p>
    <p data-start="219.28" data-end="226.42">當他開始出發時，森林裡的春天早晨格外美麗，小小的雲朵在藍天中愉快地遊玩，</p>
    <p data-start="226.50" data-end="232.78">skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out,</p>
    <p data-start="226.50" data-end="232.78">時不時地在陽光前跳躍，好像它們是來熄滅太陽的，</p>
    <p data-start="232.80" data-end="240.14">and then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn.</p>
    <p data-start="232.80" data-end="240.14">然後突然滑開，讓下一朵雲輪到它。</p>
    <p data-start="240.18" data-end="252.06">Through them and between them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily.</p>
    <p data-start="240.18" data-end="252.06">透過這些雲，陽光勇敢地照射出來；一片全年披著冷杉的灌木叢，在新綠的山毛櫸樹旁顯得又老又土氣。</p>
    <p data-start="252.06" data-end="274.50">Through copse and spinney marched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at last, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the Hundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.</p>
    <p data-start="252.06" data-end="274.50">小熊維尼穿過灌木叢和森林，沿著開放的荊棘和石床溪流，爬上砂岩陡坡，再次進入灌木叢；最後，疲憊又饑餓地來到了百畝森林。因為貓頭鷹就住在百畝森林裡。</p>
    <p data-start="277.02" data-end="300.14">"And if anyone knows anything about anything," said Bear to himself, "it's Owl who knows something about something," he said, "or my name's not Winnie-the-Pooh," he said. "Which it is," he added. "So there you are."</p>
    <p data-start="277.02" data-end="300.14">「如果有人對任何事情了解的話，」小熊維尼自言自語道，「那一定是貓頭鷹知道一些什麼。」他說，「否則我的名字不叫小熊維尼。」他又補充道，「所以你看。」</p>
    <p data-start="300.58" data-end="314.30">Owl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which was grander than anybody else's, or seemed so to Bear, because it had both a knocker and a bell-pull. Underneath the knocker there was a notice which said:</p>
    <p data-start="300.58" data-end="314.30">貓頭鷹住在「栗樹小屋」，這是一座古老的、非常迷人的住所，比其他任何地方都要華麗，或者說對小熊維尼來說似乎更華麗，因為它有一個門環和一條拉鈴。門環下面有一個通知，上面寫著：</p>
    <p data-start="314.32" data-end="344.06">PLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD.</p>
    <p data-start="314.32" data-end="344.06">請在需要答覆時按鈴。</p>
    <p data-start="344.08" data-end="364.64">yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTEREDTOAST.</p>
    <p data-start="344.08" data-end="364.64">但對像麻疹和黃油吐司這樣的精緻詞語卻搞得一塌糊塗。</p>
    <p data-start="364.80" data-end="397.90">Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud voice, "Owl! I require an answer! It's Bear speaking." And the door opened, and Owl looked out.</p>
    <p data-start="364.80" data-end="397.90">於是，他確保地敲了敲門環，拉了拉鈴索，又用非常大聲的聲音喊道，「貓頭鷹！我需要答案！我是小熊維尼。」門開了，貓頭鷹探出頭來。</p>
    <p data-start="398.00" data-end="427.58">And he's Moping about it. So could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him?"</p>
    <p data-start="398.00" data-end="427.58">「他正為此感到沮喪。那你能否非常親切地告訴我如何幫他找到尾巴？」</p>
    <p data-start="428.98" data-end="437.74">"It means the Thing to Do."</p>
    <p data-start="428.98" data-end="437.74">「這意味著該做的事情。」</p>
    <p data-start="437.76" data-end="467.66">"The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then——"</p>
    <p data-start="437.76" data-end="467.66">「該做的事情如下。首先，發放獎勳。然後——」</p>
    <p data-start="467.76" data-end="480.18">"Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed."</p>
    <p data-start="467.76" data-end="480.18">「嗯，你無法知道這個，除非有什麼東西被打噴嚏了。」</p>
    <p data-start="480.66" data-end="500.74">"A Reward!" said Owl very loudly. "We write a notice to say that we will give a large something to anybody who finds Eeyore's tail."</p>
    <p data-start="480.66" data-end="500.74">「獎勳！」貓頭鷹非常大聲地說。「我們寫一個通知，說我們會給任何找到伊爾尾巴的人一個大獎。」</p>
    <p data-start="501.08" data-end="510.10">"Talking about large somethings," he went on dreamily, "I generally have a small something about now—about this time in the morning,"</p>
    <p data-start="501.08" data-end="510.10">「說到大獎，」他夢幻般地繼續說道，「我通常這時候會有一點小東西——大約在早晨這個時候，」</p>
    <p data-start="510.10" data-end="517.42">and he looked wistfully at the cupboard in the corner of Owl's parlour;</p>
    <p data-start="510.10" data-end="517.42">他渴望地看了看貓頭鷹客廳角落的櫥櫃；</p>
    <p data-start="517.44" data-end="527.32">"just a mouthful of condensed milk or whatnot, with perhaps a lick of honey——"</p>
    <p data-start="517.44" data-end="527.32">「只是一口濃縮牛奶或其他什麼，加上一點蜂蜜——」</p>
    <p data-start="527.70" data-end="537.90">and we put it up all over the forest."</p>
    <p data-start="527.70" data-end="537.90">「然後我們就把它張貼到整個森林裡。」</p>
    <p data-start="538.08" data-end="549.78">And he gave a deep sigh, and tried very hard to listen to what Owl was saying.</p>
    <p data-start="538.08" data-end="549.78">他深深地嘆了口氣，努力地聽貓頭鷹在說什麼。</p>
    <p data-start="549.78" data-end="557.26">But Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he came back to where he started,</p>
    <p data-start="549.78" data-end="557.26">但貓頭鷹講來講去，使用越來越長的詞語，直到最後回到最初的地方，</p>
    <p data-start="557.40" data-end="564.70">and he explained that the person to write out this notice was Christopher Robin.</p>
    <p data-start="557.40" data-end="564.70">他解釋說，寫這個通知的人是克里斯多夫·羅賓。</p>
    <p data-start="564.82" data-end="574.74">Did you see them, Pooh?"</p>
    <p data-start="564.82" data-end="574.74">「你看到它們了嗎，小熊？」</p>
    <p data-start="574.74" data-end="585.14">with his eyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, "Yes, yes," last time, he said "No, not at all," now,</p>
    <p data-start="574.74" data-end="585.14">小熊維尼閉著眼睛，對貓頭鷹所說的所有話說「是的，是的」，最後一次卻說「不，完全不是」，</p>
    <p data-start="585.30" data-end="591.12">without really knowing what Owl was talking about.</p>
    <p data-start="585.30" data-end="591.12">而且完全不知道貓頭鷹在說什麼。</p>
    <p data-start="591.14" data-end="616.92">"Come and look at them now."</p>
    <p data-start="591.14" data-end="616.92">「現在來看看它們。」</p>
    <p data-start="618.04" data-end="646.60">"It reminds me of something," he said, "but I can't think what. Where did you get it?"</p>
    <p data-start="618.04" data-end="646.60">「這讓我想起了什麼，」他說，「但我想不起來。你是在哪裡得到的？」</p>
    <p data-start="647.30" data-end="664.88">"Owl," said Pooh solemnly, "you made a mistake. Somebody did want it."</p>
    <p data-start="647.30" data-end="664.88">「貓頭鷹，」小熊維尼嚴肅地說，「你犯了一個錯誤。有人確實想要它。」</p>
    <p data-start="666.30" data-end="674.88">"Fond of it?"</p>
    <p data-start="666.30" data-end="674.88">「喜歡它？」</p>
    <p data-start="675.08" data-end="694.82">and when Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore frisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that Winnie-the-Pooh came over all funny, and had to hurry home for a little snack of something to sustain him. And, wiping his mouth half an hour afterwards, he sang to himself proudly:</p>
    <p data-start="675.08" data-end="694.82">當克里斯多夫·羅賓把尾巴重新釘回原位後，伊爾在森林裡開心地跳來跳去，揮舞著尾巴，讓小熊維尼感到有些奇怪，不得不急忙回家吃點小點心來充飢。半小時後，他擦了擦嘴，自豪地對自己唱道：</p>
    <p data-start="696.16" data-end="707.66">Who found the Tail? "I," said Pooh, "At a quarter to two (Only it was quarter to eleven really), I found the Tail!"</p>
    <p data-start="696.16" data-end="707.66">誰找到了尾巴？「我，」小熊維尼說，「在一點四十五分（其實是十點四十五分），我找到了尾巴！」</p>
