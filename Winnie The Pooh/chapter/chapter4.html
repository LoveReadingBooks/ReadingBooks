    <p data-start="9.14" data-end="14.22">...IN WHICH EEYORE LOSES A TAIL AND POOH FINDS ONE</p>
    <p data-start="9.14" data-end="14.22">...在這一章中，小驢子伊爾失去了尾巴，而小熊維尼找到了尾巴</p>
    <p data-start="18.56" data-end="23.98">The Old Grey Donkey, Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest,</p>
    <p data-start="18.56" data-end="23.98">灰色老驢子伊爾獨自站在森林中的一個滿是牛蒡的角落，</p>
    <p data-start="24.76" data-end="34.84">his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought about things. Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, "Why?" and sometimes he thought, "Wherefore?"</p>
    <p data-start="24.76" data-end="34.84">前蹄分開，頭微微歪向一邊，思索著一些事情。有時他悲傷地自言自語道，「為什麼？」有時他想，「為何？」</p>
    <p data-start="35.74" data-end="48.98">and sometimes he thought, "Inasmuch as which?"—and sometimes he didn't quite know what he was thinking about.</p>
    <p data-start="35.74" data-end="48.98">有時他會想，「因為哪個？」——有時他甚至不知道自己在想什麼。</p>
    <p data-start="50.02" data-end="68.76">So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to say "How do you do?" in a gloomy manner to him. "And how are you?" said Winnie-the-Pooh. Eeyore shook his head from side to side.</p>
    <p data-start="50.02" data-end="68.76">所以當小熊維尼咚咚地走來時，伊爾非常高興能夠暫時停止思考，陰沉地對他說「你好」。「你怎麼樣？」小熊維尼問。伊唷搖了搖頭。</p>
    <p data-start="69.08" data-end="94.76">"Not very how," he said. "I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time." "Dear, dear," said Pooh, "I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at you." So Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once.</p>
    <p data-start="69.08" data-end="94.76">「不好怎麼樣，」他說。「我已經很久沒有感覺到什麼叫做好。」「唉，唉，」小熊維尼說，「我很抱歉這樣。讓我看看你。」於是伊唷站在那裡，悲傷地看著地面，小熊維尼圍著他走了一圈。</p>
    <p data-start="96.24" data-end="100.76">"Why, what's happened to your tail?" he said in surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="96.24" data-end="100.76">「怎麼了，你的尾巴怎麼了？」他驚訝地問。</p>
    <p data-start="101.84" data-end="112.60">"What has happened to it?" said Eeyore. "It isn't there!" "Are you sure?" "Well, either a tail is there or it isn't there.</p>
    <p data-start="101.84" data-end="112.60">「我的尾巴怎麼了？」伊爾說。「那裡沒有！」「你確定嗎？」「嗯，要麼有尾巴，要麼沒有尾巴。」</p>
    <p data-start="113.26" data-end="122.08">You can't make a mistake about it. And yours isn't there!" "Then what is?"</p>
    <p data-start="113.26" data-end="122.08">「你不能搞錯的。你的尾巴不見了！」「那麼，究竟是什麼呢？」</p>
    <p data-start="123.00" data-end="152.90">"Nothing." "Let's have a look," said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the place where his tail had been a little while ago, and then, finding that he couldn't catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came back to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked between his front legs, and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, "I believe you're right."</p>
    <p data-start="123.00" data-end="152.90">「沒什麼。」「我們看看吧，」伊唷說，他慢慢地轉過身，看看尾巴不久前所在的地方，然後發現找不到它，他又轉了一個方向，直到回到原來的位置。接著，他低下頭，從前腿之間看了一眼，最後，他長嘆一口氣，悲傷地說道：「我相信你說的是對的。」</p>
    <p data-start="153.00" data-end="182.96">"Of course I'm right," said Pooh. "That Accounts for a Good Deal," said Eeyore gloomily. "It Explains Everything. No Wonder." "You must have left it somewhere," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "Somebody must have taken it," said Eeyore. "How Like Them," he added, after a long silence.</p>
    <p data-start="153.00" data-end="182.96">「我當然是對的，」小熊維尼說。「這就解釋了很多事情，」伊唷沮喪地說。「這說明了一切。難怪。」「你一定是把它放在某個地方了，」小熊維尼說。「一定是有人拿走了，」伊唷說。「真是太像他們了，」他在沉默了很久後補充道。</p>
    <p data-start="183.00" data-end="193.36">Pooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn't quite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.</p>
    <p data-start="183.00" data-end="193.36">小熊維尼覺得自己應該說些有幫助的話，但不太知道該說什麼。於是他決定改做些有幫助的事情。</p>
    <p data-start="195.02" data-end="207.84">"Eeyore," he said solemnly, "I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you." "Thank you, Pooh," answered Eeyore. </p>
    <p data-start="195.02" data-end="207.84">「伊爾，」他嚴肅地說，「我，小熊維尼，會幫你找到你的尾巴。」「謝謝你，維尼，」伊唷回答道。</p>
    <p data-start="208.86" data-end="219.04">"You're a real friend," said he. "Not like Some," he said. So Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail.</p>
    <p data-start="208.86" data-end="219.04">「你真是個真正的朋友，」伊爾說。「不像有些人，」他說。於是小熊維尼出發去尋找伊唷的尾巴。</p>
    <p data-start="219.28" data-end="226.42">It was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky,</p>
    <p data-start="219.28" data-end="226.42">當他開始出發時，森林裡的春天早晨格外美麗，小小的雲朵在藍天中愉快地遊玩，</p>
    <p data-start="226.50" data-end="232.78">skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out,</p>
    <p data-start="226.50" data-end="232.78">時不時地在陽光前跳躍，好像它們是來熄滅太陽的，</p>
    <p data-start="232.80" data-end="240.14">and then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn.</p>
    <p data-start="232.80" data-end="240.14">然後突然滑開，讓下一朵雲輪到它。</p>
    <p data-start="240.18" data-end="252.06">Through them and between them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily.</p>
    <p data-start="240.18" data-end="252.06">透過這些雲，陽光勇敢地照射出來；一片全年披著冷杉的灌木叢，在新綠的山毛櫸樹旁顯得又老又土氣。</p>
    <p data-start="252.06" data-end="274.50">Through copse and spinney marched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at last, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the Hundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.</p>
    <p data-start="252.06" data-end="274.50">小熊維尼穿過灌木叢和森林，沿著開放的荊棘和石床溪流，爬上砂岩陡坡，再次進入灌木叢；最後，疲憊又饑餓地來到了百畝森林。因為貓頭鷹就住在百畝森林裡。</p>
    <p data-start="277.02" data-end="300.14">"And if anyone knows anything about anything," said Bear to himself, "it's Owl who knows something about something," he said, "or my name's not Winnie-the-Pooh," he said. "Which it is," he added. "So there you are."</p>
    <p data-start="277.02" data-end="300.14">「如果有人對任何事情了解的話，」小熊維尼自言自語道，「那一定是貓頭鷹知道一些什麼。」他說，「否則我的名字不叫小熊維尼。」他又補充道，「所以你看。」</p>
    <p data-start="300.58" data-end="314.30">Owl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which was grander than anybody else's, or seemed so to Bear, because it had both a knocker and a bell-pull. Underneath the knocker there was a notice which said:</p>
    <p data-start="300.58" data-end="314.30">貓頭鷹住在「栗樹小屋」，這是一座古老的、非常迷人的住所，比其他任何地方都要華麗，或者說對小熊維尼來說似乎更華麗，因為它有一個門環和一條拉鈴。門環下面有一個通知，上面寫著：</p>
    <p data-start="314.32" data-end="344.06">PLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD. Underneath the bell-pull there was a notice which said: PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID. These notices had been written by Christopher Robin, who was the only one in the forest who could spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many ways, able to read and write and spell his own name WOL,</p>
    <p data-start="314.32" data-end="344.06">請在需要答覆時按鈴。在鈴繩下方有一張告示，上面寫著：**“如無需回應，請勿按鈴。”** 這些告示是克里斯多夫·羅賓寫的，他是森林裡唯一能夠拼字的人；因為貓頭鷹雖然在很多方面很智慧，能夠讀寫並拼寫自己的名字“WOL”，但還是無法拼寫其他單詞。</p>
    <p data-start="344.08" data-end="364.64">yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTEREDTOAST. Winnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very carefully, first from left to right, and afterwards, in case he had missed some of it, from right to left.</p>
    <p data-start="344.08" data-end="364.64">但對像麻疹和黃油吐司這樣的精緻詞語卻搞得一塌糊塗。小熊維尼非常仔細地閱讀了這兩張告示，先是從左到右，然後為了避免漏掉什麼，他又從右到左閱讀了一遍。</p>
    <p data-start="364.80" data-end="397.90">Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud voice, "Owl! I require an answer! It's Bear speaking." And the door opened, and Owl looked out. "Hallo, Pooh," he said. "How's things?" "Terrible and Sad," said Pooh, "because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine, has lost his tail.</p>
    <p data-start="364.80" data-end="397.90">於是，他確保地敲了敲門環，拉了拉鈴索，又用非常大聲的聲音喊道，「貓頭鷹！我需要答案！我是小熊維尼。」門開了，貓頭鷹探出頭來。「你好，維尼，」他說。「最近怎麼樣？」「非常糟糕和悲傷，」維尼說，「因為伊唷，我的朋友，丟了他的尾巴。」</p>
    <p data-start="398.00" data-end="427.58">And he's Moping about it. So could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him?" "Well," said Owl, "the customary procedure in such cases is as follows." "What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?" said Pooh. "For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and long words Bother me."</p>
    <p data-start="398.00" data-end="427.58">「他正為此感到沮喪。那你能否非常親切地告訴我如何幫他找到尾巴？」「嗯，」貓頭鷹說，「在這種情況下，通常的程序如下。」「‘慣例程序’是什麼意思？」維尼問。「因為我是一隻腦袋很小的熊，長詞語讓我困擾。」</p>
    <p data-start="428.98" data-end="437.74">"It means the Thing to Do." "As long as it means that, I don't mind," said Pooh humbly.</p>
    <p data-start="428.98" data-end="437.74">「這意味著該做的事情。」「只要它是這個意思，我不介意，」維尼謙遜地說。</p>
    <p data-start="437.76" data-end="467.66">"The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then——" "Just a moment," said Pooh, holding up his paw. "What do we do to this—what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me." "I didn't sneeze." "Yes, you did, Owl." "Excuse me, Pooh, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it."</p>
    <p data-start="437.76" data-end="467.66">「該做的事情如下。首先，發放獎勳。然後——」「等一下，」維尼說，舉起了他的爪子。「我們該怎麼做這個——你剛才說的那個？你打噴嚏的時候正要告訴我。」 「我沒有打噴嚏。」 「是的，你打了，貓頭鷹。」 「抱歉，維尼，我沒有。你打噴嚏是會知道的。」</p>
    <p data-start="467.76" data-end="480.18">"Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed." "What I said was, 'First Issue a Reward'." "You're doing it again," said Pooh sadly.</p>
    <p data-start="467.76" data-end="480.18">「嗯，你無法知道這個，除非有什麼東西被打噴嚏了。」「我剛才說的是，‘首先發佈獎勳’。」 「你又來了，」維尼悲傷地說。</p>
    <p data-start="480.66" data-end="500.74">"A Reward!" said Owl very loudly. "We write a notice to say that we will give a large something to anybody who finds Eeyore's tail." "I see, I see," said Pooh, nodding his head.</p>
    <p data-start="480.66" data-end="500.74">「獎勳！」貓頭鷹非常大聲地說。「我們寫一個通知，說我們會給任何找到伊爾尾巴的人一個大獎。」「我明白了，我明白了，」維尼說，點了點頭。</p>
    <p data-start="501.08" data-end="510.10">"Talking about large somethings," he went on dreamily, "I generally have a small something about now—about this time in the morning,"</p>
    <p data-start="501.08" data-end="510.10">「說到大獎，」他夢幻般地繼續說道，「我通常這時候會有一點小東西——大約在早晨這個時候，」</p>
    <p data-start="510.10" data-end="517.42">and he looked wistfully at the cupboard in the corner of Owl's parlour;</p>
    <p data-start="510.10" data-end="517.42">他渴望地看了看貓頭鷹客廳角落的櫥櫃；</p>
    <p data-start="517.44" data-end="527.32">"just a mouthful of condensed milk or whatnot, with perhaps a lick of honey——" "Well, then," said Owl, "we write out this notice,</p>
    <p data-start="517.44" data-end="527.32">「只是一口濃縮牛奶或其他什麼，加上一點蜂蜜——」「那麼，」貓頭鷹說，「我們就寫這個告示，</p>
    <p data-start="527.70" data-end="537.90">and we put it up all over the forest." "A lick of honey," murmured Bear to himself, "or—or not, as the case may be."</p>
    <p data-start="527.70" data-end="537.90">「然後我們就把它張貼到整個森林裡。」「一舔蜂蜜，」熊輕聲對自己說，「或者——或者不舔，視情況而定。」</p>
    <p data-start="538.08" data-end="549.78">And he gave a deep sigh, and tried very hard to listen to what Owl was saying.</p>
    <p data-start="538.08" data-end="549.78">他深深地嘆了口氣，努力地聽貓頭鷹在說什麼。</p>
    <p data-start="549.78" data-end="557.26">But Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he came back to where he started,</p>
    <p data-start="549.78" data-end="557.26">但貓頭鷹講來講去，使用越來越長的詞語，直到最後回到最初的地方，</p>
    <p data-start="557.40" data-end="564.70">and he explained that the person to write out this notice was Christopher Robin. "It was he who wrote the ones on my front door for me.</p>
    <p data-start="557.40" data-end="564.70">他解釋說，寫這個通知的人是克里斯多夫·羅賓。「是他為我寫了我前門上的那些告示。」</p>
    <p data-start="564.82" data-end="574.74">Did you see them, Pooh?" For some time now Pooh had been saying "Yes" and "No" in turn,</p>
    <p data-start="564.82" data-end="574.74">「你看到它們了嗎，小熊？」一段時間以來，維尼一直在輪流說「是」和「不是」，</p>
    <p data-start="574.74" data-end="585.14">with his eyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, "Yes, yes," last time, he said "No, not at all," now,</p>
    <p data-start="574.74" data-end="585.14">小熊維尼閉著眼睛，對貓頭鷹所說的所有話說「是的，是的」，最後一次卻說「不，完全不是」，</p>
    <p data-start="585.30" data-end="591.12">without really knowing what Owl was talking about. "Didn't you see them?" said Owl, a little surprised.</p>
    <p data-start="585.30" data-end="591.12">而且完全不知道貓頭鷹在說什麼。「你沒有看到它們嗎？」貓頭鷹說，稍微有些驚訝。</p>
    <p data-start="591.14" data-end="616.92">"Come and look at them now." So they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice below it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and the more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen something like it, somewhere else, sometime before. "Handsome bell-rope, isn't it?" said Owl. Pooh nodded.</p>
    <p data-start="591.14" data-end="616.92">「現在來看看它們。」於是他們走到外面。維尼看了看門環和下面的告示，又看了看鈴繩和下面的告示，他看鈴繩的時間越長，就越覺得之前在別的地方見過類似的東西。「這鈴繩很漂亮，不是嗎？」貓頭鷹說。維尼點了點頭。</p>
    <p data-start="618.04" data-end="646.60">"It reminds me of something," he said, "but I can't think what. Where did you get it?" "I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I thought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing happened, and then I rang it again very loudly, and it came off in my hand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and——"</p>
    <p data-start="618.04" data-end="646.60">「這讓我想起了什麼，」他說，「但我想不起來。你是在哪裡得到的？」「我在森林裡碰到它的。它掛在一叢灌木上，我一開始以為那裡有人住，所以我按了鈴，但沒有任何反應，然後我又很大聲地按了一次，結果它從鈴繩上掉到我手裡，既然沒有人似乎想要它，我就把它帶回了家，然後——」</p>
    <p data-start="647.30" data-end="664.88">"Owl," said Pooh solemnly, "you made a mistake. Somebody did want it." "Who?" "Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was—he was fond of it."</p>
    <p data-start="647.30" data-end="664.88">「貓頭鷹，」小熊維尼嚴肅地說，「你犯了一個錯誤。有人確實想要它。」「誰？」「伊唷。我的親愛的朋友伊唷。他——他很喜歡這個。」</p>
    <p data-start="666.30" data-end="674.88">"Fond of it?" "Attached to it," said Winnie-the-Pooh sadly. So with these words he unhooked it, and carried it back to Eeyore;</p>
    <p data-start="666.30" data-end="674.88">「喜歡它？」「附在上面，」小熊維尼悲傷地說。於是他說完這句話，將它取下來，帶回給伊唷；</p>
    <p data-start="675.08" data-end="694.82">and when Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore frisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that Winnie-the-Pooh came over all funny, and had to hurry home for a little snack of something to sustain him. And, wiping his mouth half an hour afterwards, he sang to himself proudly:</p>
    <p data-start="675.08" data-end="694.82">當克里斯多夫·羅賓把尾巴重新釘回原位後，伊爾在森林裡開心地跳來跳去，揮舞著尾巴，讓小熊維尼感到有些奇怪，不得不急忙回家吃點小點心來充飢。半小時後，他擦了擦嘴，自豪地對自己唱道：</p>
    <p data-start="696.16" data-end="707.66">Who found the Tail? "I," said Pooh, "At a quarter to two (Only it was quarter to eleven really), I found the Tail!"</p>
    <p data-start="696.16" data-end="707.66">誰找到了尾巴？「我，」小熊維尼說，「在一點四十五分（其實是十點四十五分），我找到了尾巴！」</p>
