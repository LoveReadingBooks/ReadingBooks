    <p data-start="9.46" data-end="15.70">...IN WHICH KANGA AND BABY ROO COME TO THE FOREST, AND PIGLET HAS A BATH</p>
    <p data-start="9.46" data-end="15.70">...在這章裡，袋鼠媽媽和小袋鼠來到森林，而小豬洗了個澡。</p>
    <p data-start="18.28" data-end="24.70">NOBODY seemed to know where they came from, but there they were in the Forest: Kanga and Baby Roo.</p>
    <p data-start="18.28" data-end="24.70">沒有人知道他們從哪裡來的，但他們就這樣出現在森林裡：袋鼠媽媽和小袋鼠。</p>
    <p data-start="25.66" data-end="31.32">When Pooh asked Christopher Robin, "How did they come here?" Christopher Robin said,</p>
    <p data-start="25.66" data-end="31.32">當小熊維尼問克里斯多夫·羅賓：「他們是怎麼來的？」克里斯多夫·羅賓說，</p>
    <p data-start="32.30" data-end="41.28">"In the Usual Way, if you know what I mean, Pooh," and Pooh, who didn't, said "Oh!" Then he nodded his head twice and said,</p>
    <p data-start="32.30" data-end="41.28">「按照通常的方式，如果你懂我的意思，小熊維尼。」而不懂的小熊維尼說：「哦！」然後他點了兩下頭，說，</p>
    <p data-start="42.08" data-end="48.94">"In the Usual Way. Ah!" Then he went to call upon his friend Piglet to see what he thought about it.</p>
    <p data-start="42.08" data-end="48.94">「按照通常的方式。啊！」接著他去拜訪他的朋友小豬，看看他對這事有什麼看法。</p>
    <p data-start="49.72" data-end="77.98">And at Piglet's house he found Rabbit. So they all talked about it together. "What I don't like about it is this," said Rabbit. "Here are we--you, Pooh, and you, Piglet, and Me --and suddenly " "And Eeyore," said Pooh. "And Eeyore--and then suddenly--" "And Owl," said Pooh "And Owl--and then all of a sudden--" "Oh, and Eeyore," said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="49.72" data-end="77.98">在小豬的家裡，他遇到了兔子。所以他們一起討論了這件事。「我不喜歡這件事的地方在於，」兔子說。「我們在這裡——你，小熊維尼，你，小豬，還有我——然後突然間——」「還有屹耳。」小熊維尼說。「還有屹耳——然後突然——」「還有貓頭鷹。」小熊維尼說。「還有貓頭鷹——然後突然之間——」「哦，還有屹耳。」小熊維尼說。</p>
    <p data-start="78.00" data-end="107.90">"I was forgetting him." "Here--we--are," said Rabbit very slowly and carefully, all--or--us, and then, suddenly, we wake up one morning, and what do we find? We find a Strange Animal among us. An animal of whom we had never even heard before! An animal who carries her family about with her in her pocket!</p>
    <p data-start="78.00" data-end="107.90">「我差點忘了他。」兔子非常慢且小心地說：「我們在這裡——我們所有的人，然後突然有一天早上醒來，我們發現了什麼？我們發現我們中間出現了一個陌生的動物。這是一個我們從來沒有聽說過的動物！一個會把她的家人裝在口袋裡隨身攜帶的動物！」</p>
    <p data-start="108.06" data-end="117.34">Suppose I carried my family about with me in my pocket, how many pockets should I want?" "Sixteen," said Piglet. "Seventeen, isn't it?" said Rabbit.</p>
    <p data-start="108.06" data-end="117.34">「假設我也把家人裝在口袋裡隨身攜帶，我需要多少個口袋？」小豬說：「十六個。」兔子說：「不是十七個嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="117.62" data-end="147.28">"And one more for a handkerchief--that's eighteen. Eighteen pockets in one suit! I haven't time." There was a long and thoughtful silence? . . and then Pooh, who had been frowning very hard for some minutes, said: "I make it fifteen." "What?" said Rabbit. "Fifteen." "Fifteen what?" "Your family." "What about them?" Pooh rubbed his nose and said that he thought Rabbit had been talking about his family.</p>
    <p data-start="117.62" data-end="147.28">「再加上一個放手帕的——那就是十八個。一套衣服上有十八個口袋！我沒那麼多時間。」場面陷入了長時間的沉思……然後小熊維尼皺著眉頭沉思了幾分鐘，說：「我算出來是十五個。」兔子說：「什麼？」小熊維尼說：「十五個。」兔子說：「十五個什麼？」小熊維尼說：「你的家人。」兔子說：「怎麼了？」小熊維尼摸了摸鼻子，說他以為兔子在說他的家人。</p>
    <p data-start="147.36" data-end="163.36">"Did I?" said Rabbit carelessly. "Yes, you said--" "Never mind, Pooh," said Piglet impatiently. "The question is, What are we to do about Kanga?" "Oh, I see," said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="147.36" data-end="163.36">「我有說過嗎？」兔子漫不經心地說。「是的，你說了——」「別管了，小熊維尼，」小豬不耐煩地說。「問題是，我們該怎麼對付袋鼠媽媽？」小熊維尼說：「哦，我明白了。」</p>
    <p data-start="165.36" data-end="177.20">"The best way," said Rabbit, "would be this. The best way would be to steal Baby Roo and hide him, and then when Kanga says, 'Where's Baby Roo?' we say, 'Aha!'"</p>
    <p data-start="165.36" data-end="177.20">兔子說：「最好的辦法是這樣的。最好的辦法是偷走小袋鼠，把他藏起來，然後當袋鼠媽媽問，『小袋鼠在哪裡？』我們就說，『啊哈！』」</p>
    <p data-start="178.48" data-end="192.34">"Aha!" said Pooh, practising. "Aha! Aha! . . . Of course," he went on, "we could say 'Aha!' even if we hadn't stolen Baby Roo."</p>
    <p data-start="178.48" data-end="192.34">「啊哈！」小熊維尼練習著說。「啊哈！啊哈！……當然，」他接著說，「即使我們沒有偷走小袋鼠，我們也可以說『啊哈！』」</p>
    <p data-start="192.34" data-end="204.38">"Pooh," said Rabbit kindly, "you haven't any brain." "I know," said Pooh humbly.</p>
    <p data-start="192.34" data-end="204.38">兔子溫和地說：「小熊維尼，你沒有腦子。」小熊維尼謙卑地說：「我知道。」</p>
    <p data-start="204.78" data-end="213.16">"We say 'Aha!' so that Kanga knows that we know where Baby Roo is. 'Aha!' means 'We'll tell you where Baby Roo is,</p>
    <p data-start="204.78" data-end="213.16">「我們說『啊哈！』，這樣袋鼠媽媽就知道我們知道小袋鼠在哪裡。『啊哈！』的意思是『我們告訴你小袋鼠在哪裡。</p>
    <p data-start="213.20" data-end="221.18">if you promise to go away from the Forest and never come back.' Now don't talk while I think."</p>
    <p data-start="213.20" data-end="221.18">如果你答應離開這片森林並永遠不再回來。 現在別說話，讓我想一想。」</p>
    <p data-start="221.18" data-end="227.50">Pooh went into a corner and tried saying 'Aha!' in that sort of voice.</p>
    <p data-start="221.18" data-end="227.50">小熊維尼走到一個角落，試著用那種聲音說「啊哈！」</p>
    <p data-start="227.52" data-end="236.46">Sometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what Rabbit said, and sometimes it seemed to him that it didn't. "I suppose it's just practice," he thought.</p>
    <p data-start="227.52" data-end="236.46">有時候他覺得這意味著兔子所說的意思，有時候他覺得並不是。「我猜這只是需要練習，」他想。</p>
    <p data-start="237.82" data-end="246.08">"I wonder if Kanga will have to practise too so as to understand it." "There's just one thing," said Piglet,</p>
    <p data-start="237.82" data-end="246.08">「我想知道袋鼠媽媽是否也需要練習才能理解。」小豬說：「還有一件事，」</p>
    <p data-start="246.30" data-end="260.94">fidgeting a bit. "I was talking to Christopher Robin, and he said that a Kanga was Generally Regarded as One of the Fiercer Animals I am not frightened of Fierce Animals in the ordinary way,</p>
    <p data-start="246.30" data-end="260.94">他有點坐立不安。「我和克里斯多夫·羅賓說話時，他說袋鼠通常被認為是比較兇猛的動物之一。我平時並不怕兇猛的動物，</p>
    <p data-start="260.98" data-end="268.38">but it is well known that if One of the Fiercer Animals is Deprived of Its Young,</p>
    <p data-start="260.98" data-end="268.38">但大家都知道，如果一個兇猛的動物失去了它的幼崽，</p>
    <p data-start="268.38" data-end="275.70">it becomes as fierce as Two of the Fiercer Animals. In which case 'Aha!' is perhaps a foolish thing to say."</p>
    <p data-start="268.38" data-end="275.70">它會變得像兩個兇猛的動物那樣兇猛。在這種情況下，『啊哈！』或許是個愚蠢的說法。」</p>
    <p data-start="277.14" data-end="282.78">"Piglet," said Rabbit, taking out a pencil, and licking the end of it, "you haven't any pluck."</p>
    <p data-start="277.14" data-end="282.78">「小豬，」兔子一邊說，一邊拿出一支鉛筆，舔了舔筆尖，「你沒有什麼勇氣。」</p>
    <p data-start="284.48" data-end="302.18">"It is hard to be brave," said Piglet, sniffing slightly, "when you're only a Very Small Animal." Rabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said: "It is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in the adventure before us."</p>
    <p data-start="284.48" data-end="302.18">「當你只是一隻非常小的動物時，」小豬稍微抽噎著說，「要勇敢是很難的。」正在忙著寫字的兔子抬起頭來說：「正因為你是一隻非常小的動物，你才會在我們接下來的冒險中派上用場。」</p>
    <p data-start="303.88" data-end="323.40">Piglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful that he forgot to be frightened any more, and when Rabbit went on to say that Kangas were only Fierce during the winter months, being at other times of an Affectionate Disposition, he could hardly sit still, he was so eager to begin being useful at once.</p>
    <p data-start="303.88" data-end="323.40">小豬一想到自己能派上用場就非常興奮，以至於忘記了害怕。當兔子接著說袋鼠只在冬天才兇猛，其他時候性情溫和時，他幾乎坐不住了，迫不及待地想要馬上開始派上用場。</p>
    <p data-start="325.04" data-end="326.32">"What about me?"</p>
    <p data-start="325.04" data-end="326.32">「那我呢？」</p>
    <p data-start="327.06" data-end="353.68">said Pooh sadly "I suppose I shan't be useful?" "Never mind, Pooh," said Piglet comfortingly. "Another time perhaps " "Without Pooh," said Rabbit solemnly as he sharpened his pencil, "the adventure would be impossible." "Oh!" said Piglet, and tried not to look disappointed. But Pooh went into a corner of the room and said proudly to himself,</p>
    <p data-start="327.06" data-end="353.68">小熊維尼傷心地說：「我想我派不上用場吧？」小豬安慰地說：「別擔心，小熊維尼，也許下次吧。」兔子一邊嚴肅地削著鉛筆一邊說：「沒有小熊維尼，這次冒險就不可能成功。」小豬說：「哦！」並努力不表現出失望的樣子。但小熊維尼走到房間的一個角落，驕傲地對自己說，</p>
    <p data-start="354.94" data-end="382.00">"Impossible without Me! That sort of Bear." "Now listen all of you," said Rabbit when he had finished writing, and Pooh and Piglet sat listening very eagerly with their mouths open. This was what Rabbit read out: PLAN TO CAPTURE BABY ROO 1. General Remarks. Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me. 2. More General Remarks. Kanga never takes her eye off Baby Roo, except when he's safely buttoned up in her pocket. 3. Therefore. If we are to capture Baby Roo, we must get a Long Start, because Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me. (See I.)</p>
    <p data-start="354.94" data-end="382.00">「沒有我就不可能！就是這種熊。」當兔子寫完後說：「現在你們都聽著，」小熊維尼和小豬張著嘴巴，非常熱切地聽著。這是兔子讀出的內容：捕捉小袋鼠的計劃 1. 總體說明：袋鼠跑得比我們任何一個人都快，甚至比我還快。 2. 更多總體說明：袋鼠從不離開小袋鼠的視線，除非他已經被安全地扣在她的口袋裡。 3. 因此，如果我們要抓住小袋鼠，我們必須有一個長遠的計劃，因為袋鼠跑得比我們任何一個人都快，甚至比我還快。（參見第1條。）</p>
    <p data-start="383.76" data-end="412.82">4. A Thought. If Roo had jumped out of Kanga's pocket and Piglet had jumped in, Kanga wouldn't know the difference, because Piglet is a Very Small Animal.</p>
    <p data-start="383.76" data-end="412.82">4. 一個想法：如果小袋鼠從袋鼠媽媽的口袋裡跳出來，而小豬跳進去，袋鼠媽媽不會發現差別，因為小豬是一隻非常小的動物。</p>
    <p data-start="412.84" data-end="442.10">5. Like Roo. 6. But Kanga would have to be looking the other way first, so as not to see Piglet jumping in. 7. See 2. 8. Another Thought. But if Pooh was talking to her very excitedly, she might look the other way for a moment. 9. And then I could run away with Roo.</p>
    <p data-start="412.84" data-end="442.10">5. 像小袋鼠一樣。 6. 但是袋鼠媽媽必須先轉過頭去，這樣才不會看到小豬跳進去。 7. 參見第2條。 8. 另一個想法：但如果小熊維尼非常激動地與她說話，她可能會轉過頭去看別的地方一會兒。 9. 然後我就可以帶著小袋鼠跑掉。</p>
    <p data-start="442.60" data-end="472.54">1O. Quickly. 11. And Kanga wouldn't discover the difference until Afterwards Well, Rabbit read this out proudly, and for a little while after he had read it nobody said anything And then Piglet, who had been opening and shutting his mouth without making any noise, managed to say very huskily: "And--Afterwards?" "How do you mean?"</p>
    <p data-start="442.60" data-end="472.54">10. 要快。 11. 而且袋鼠媽媽要到後來才會發現差別。兔子驕傲地讀完這些後，大家都沒說話。過了一會兒，小豬一直開開合合嘴卻沒發出聲音，終於沙啞地說：「然後……接下來呢？」兔子說：「你是什麼意思？」</p>
    <p data-start="472.56" data-end="488.76">"When Kanga does Discover the Difference?" "Then we all say 'Aha!'" "All three of us?" "Yes." "Oh!" "Why, what's the trouble, Piglet?" "Nothing," said Piglet, "as long as we all three say it.</p>
    <p data-start="472.56" data-end="488.76">「當袋鼠媽媽發現差別的時候呢？」兔子說：「那時我們都說『啊哈！』」小豬說：「我們三個都說嗎？」兔子說：「是的。」小豬說：「哦！」兔子說：「怎麼了，小豬？」小豬說：「沒什麼，只要我們三個都說就好。」</p>
    <p data-start="488.84" data-end="496.62">As long as we all three say it," said Piglet, "I don't mind," he said, "but I shouldn't care to say 'Aha!' by myself.</p>
    <p data-start="488.84" data-end="496.62">小豬說：「只要我們三個都說，」他說：「我不介意，但是我不想自己一個人說『啊哈！』」</p>
    <p data-start="497.30" data-end="526.44">It wouldn't sound nearly so well. By the way," he said, "you are quite sure about what you said about the winter months?" "The winter months?" "Yes, only being Fierce in the Winter Months." "Oh, yes, yes, that's all right. Well, Pooh You see what you have to do?" "No," said Pooh Bear. "Not yet," he said? "What do I do?"</p>
    <p data-start="497.30" data-end="526.44">「這樣說起來就沒那麼好聽了。順便問一下，」他說，「你對冬天那段話真的很確定嗎？」兔子說：「冬天那段話？」小豬說：「是的，只有冬天才兇猛。」兔子說：「哦，是的，是的，沒錯。好了，小熊維尼，你明白你要做什麼了嗎？」小熊維尼說：「不，」他說：「還不明白，我該做什麼？」</p>
    <p data-start="526.82" data-end="556.44">"Well, you just have to talk very hard to Kanga? so as she doesn't notice anything." "Oh! What about?" "Anything you like." "You mean like telling her a little bit of poetry or something?" "That's it," said Rabbit. "Splendid Now come along." So they all went out to look for Kanga. Kanga and Roo were spending a quiet afternoon in a sandy part of the Forest.</p>
    <p data-start="526.82" data-end="556.44">兔子說：「嗯，你只要拼命地和袋鼠媽媽說話，讓她注意不到其他事情就行了。」小熊維尼說：「哦！說什麼呢？」兔子說：「你喜歡說什麼就說什麼。」小熊維尼說：「你是說像給她念點詩什麼的？」兔子說：「就是這樣，」兔子說。「太好了，現在走吧。」於是他們都出去找袋鼠媽媽了。袋鼠媽媽和小袋鼠正在森林中一片沙地裡度過一個安靜的下午。</p>
    <p data-start="557.36" data-end="586.50">Baby Roo was practising very small jumps in the sand, and falling down mouse-holes and climbing out of them, and Kanga was fidgeting about and saying "Just one more jump, dear, and then we must go home." And at that moment who should come stumping up the hill but Pooh. "Good afternoon, Kanga." "Good afternoon, Pooh." "Look at me jumping," squeaked Roo, and fell into another mouse-hole.</p>
    <p data-start="557.36" data-end="586.50">小袋鼠在沙地裡練習非常小的跳躍，掉進老鼠洞裡又爬出來，而袋鼠媽媽在一旁有些坐立不安地說：「再跳一次，親愛的，我們就要回家了。」就在這時，小熊維尼上了山。「午安，袋鼠媽媽。」袋鼠媽媽說：「午安，小熊維尼。」小袋鼠尖叫道：「看我跳！」然後又掉進了一個老鼠洞。</p>
    <p data-start="586.52" data-end="596.84">"Hallo, Roo, my little fellow!" "We were just going home," said Kanga. "Good afternoon, Rabbit. Good afternoon, Piglet."</p>
    <p data-start="586.52" data-end="596.84">「你好，小袋鼠，我的小傢伙！」袋鼠媽媽說：「我們正準備回家呢。」又說：「午安，兔子。午安，小豬。」</p>
    <p data-start="597.10" data-end="605.88">Rabbit and Piglet, who had now come up from the other side of the hill, said "Good afternoon," and "Hallo, Roo,"</p>
    <p data-start="597.10" data-end="605.88">兔子和小豬這時從山的另一邊上來，說：「午安，」和「你好，小袋鼠。」</p>
    <p data-start="606.62" data-end="613.46">and Roo asked them to look at him jumping, so they stayed and looked. And Kanga looked too....</p>
    <p data-start="606.62" data-end="613.46">然後小袋鼠請他們看他跳，他們就留下來看。袋鼠媽媽也看著……</p>
    <p data-start="613.56" data-end="643.02">"Oh, Kanga," said Pooh, after Rabbit had winked at him twice, "I don't know if you are interested in Poetry at all?" "Hardly at all," said Kanga. "Oh!" said Pooh. "Roo, dear, just one more jump and then we must go home." There was a short silence while Roo fell down another mouse-hole. "Go on,"</p>
    <p data-start="613.56" data-end="643.02">「哦，袋鼠媽媽，」當兔子朝他眨了兩次眼睛後，小熊維尼說：「不知道你對詩感不感興趣？」袋鼠媽媽說：「幾乎不感興趣。」小熊維尼說：「哦！」袋鼠媽媽說：「小袋鼠，親愛的，再跳一次，我們就回家。」就在小袋鼠又掉進一個老鼠洞時，短暫的沉默後，兔子在後面捂著爪子大聲耳語道：「繼續說。」</p>
    <p data-start="643.20" data-end="659.58">said Rabbit in a loud whisper behind his paw. "Talking of Poetry," said Pooh, "I made up a little piece as I was coming along. It went like this. Er--now let me see--"</p>
    <p data-start="643.20" data-end="659.58">小熊維尼說：「說到詩，」小熊維尼說，「我剛來時編了一小段。是這樣的……呃……讓我想想……」</p>
    <p data-start="660.76" data-end="669.00">"Fancy!" said Kanga. "Now Roo, dear--" "You'll like this piece of poetry," said Rabbit. "You'll love it," said Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="660.76" data-end="669.00">袋鼠媽媽說：「真巧！」然後說：「小袋鼠，親愛的……」兔子說：「你會喜歡這段詩的。」小豬說：「你會愛上它的。」</p>
    <p data-start="670.30" data-end="687.04">"You must listen very carefully," said Rabbit. "So as not to miss any of it," said Piglet. "Oh, yes," said Kanga, but she still looked at Baby Roo. "How did it go, Pooh?" said Rabbit. Pooh gave a little cough and began.</p>
    <p data-start="670.30" data-end="687.04">兔子說：「你一定要非常認真地聽，」小豬說：「這樣才不會漏掉任何一部分。」袋鼠媽媽說：「哦，是的。」但她仍然看著小袋鼠。兔子說：「小熊維尼，這段詩怎麼說來著？」小熊維尼輕輕咳了一聲，然後開始念。</p>
    <p data-start="689.32" data-end="702.38">LINES WRITTEN BY A BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN On Monday, when the sun is hot I wonder to myself a lot:</p>
    <p data-start="689.32" data-end="702.38">由腦袋很小的熊所寫的詩 在星期一，當太陽很熱時 我經常對自己想：</p>
    <p data-start="703.26" data-end="714.34">"Now is it true, or is it not," "That what is which and which is what?" On Tuesday, when it hails and snows,</p>
    <p data-start="703.26" data-end="714.34">「這到底是真是假，」 「什麼是什麼，什麼是什麼？」 在星期二，當冰雹和雪落下時，</p>
    <p data-start="715.06" data-end="744.66">The feeling on me grows and grows That hardly anybody knows If those are these or these are those. On Wednesday, when the sky is blue, And I have nothing else to do, I sometimes wonder if it's true That who is what and what is who. On Thursday, when it starts to freeze</p>
    <p data-start="715.06" data-end="744.66">這種感覺越來越強烈 幾乎沒有人知道 那些是這些，還是這些是那些。 在星期三，當天空湛藍時， 我無事可做， 有時我會想這是否是真的 誰是什麼，什麼又是誰。 在星期四，當開始結冰</p>
    <p data-start="744.68" data-end="760.16">And hoar-frost twinkles on the trees, How very readily one sees That these are whose--but whose are these? On Friday---- "Yes, it is, isn't it?"</p>

    <p data-start="760.24" data-end="772.80">said Kanga, not waiting to hear what happened on Friday. "Just one more jump, Roo, dear, and then we really must be going." Rabbit gave Pooh a hurrying-up sort of nudge.</p>
    <p data-start="760.24" data-end="772.80">袋鼠媽媽說，不等聽完星期五發生了什麼。「再跳一次，小袋鼠，親愛的，然後我們真的該走了。」兔子輕輕推了小熊維尼一下，催促他。</p>
    <p data-start="774.28" data-end="802.94">"Talking of Poetry," said Pooh quickly "have you ever noticed that tree right over there?" "Where?" said Kanga. "Now, Roo--" "Right over there," said Pooh, pointing behind Kanga's back. "No," said Kanga. "Now jump in, Roo, dear, and we'll go home." "You ought to look at that tree right over there," said Rabbit. "Shall I lift you in, Roo?" And he picked up Roo in his paws.</p>
    <p data-start="774.28" data-end="802.94">「說到詩，」小熊維尼快速地說，「你有沒有注意到那邊那棵樹？」 「哪裡？」袋鼠媽媽說。「現在，小袋鼠——」 「就在那裡，」小熊維尼指著袋鼠媽媽背後說。「沒有啊，」袋鼠媽媽說。「現在跳進來吧，小袋鼠，親愛的，我們要回家了。」 「你應該看看那棵樹，」兔子說。「要我把你抱進去嗎，小袋鼠？」說著他用爪子抱起了小袋鼠。</p>
    <p data-start="804.58" data-end="832.94">"I can see a bird in it from here," said Pooh. "Or is it a fish?" "You ought to see that bird from here," said Rabbit. "Unless it's a fish." "It isn't a fish, it's a bird," said Piglet. "So it is," said Rabbit. "Is it a starling or a blackbird?" said Pooh. "That's the whole question," said Rabbit. "Is it a blackbird or a starling?"</p>
    <p data-start="804.58" data-end="832.94">「我從這裡能看到樹上的一隻鳥，」小熊維尼說。「還是隻魚？」 「你應該從這裡看到那隻鳥，」兔子說。「除非那是一條魚。」 「那不是魚，是隻鳥，」小豬說。「的確是，」兔子說。「那是椋鳥還是烏鶇？」小熊維尼問。「這是個大問題，」兔子說。「那是烏鶇還是椋鳥？」</p>
    <p data-start="833.00" data-end="849.40">And then at last Kanga did turn her head to look. And the moment that her head was turned, Rabbit said in a loud voice "In you go, Roo!" and in jumped Piglet into Kanga's pocket, and off scampered Rabbit, with Roo in his paws, as fast as he could.</p>
    <p data-start="833.00" data-end="849.40">然後袋鼠媽媽終於轉過頭去看了。而就在她轉頭的那一刻，兔子大聲說：「跳進去吧，小袋鼠！」於是小豬跳進了袋鼠媽媽的口袋，兔子則抱著小袋鼠飛快地跑掉了。</p>
    <p data-start="850.82" data-end="860.94">"Why, where's Rabbit?" said Kanga, turning round again. "Are you all right, Roo, dear?" Piglet made a squeaky Roo-noise from the bottom of Kanga's pocket.</p>
    <p data-start="850.82" data-end="860.94">「咦，兔子哪去了？」袋鼠媽媽轉過身問。「你還好嗎，小袋鼠，親愛的？」 小豬在袋鼠媽媽的口袋底部發出了小袋鼠的吱吱聲。</p>
    <p data-start="861.80" data-end="890.12">"Rabbit had to go away," said Pooh. "I think he thought of something he had to do and see about suddenly." "And Piglet?" "I think Piglet thought of something at the same time. Suddenly." "Well, we must be getting home," said Kanga. "Good-bye, Pooh." And in three large jumps she was gone. Pooh looked after her as she went.</p>
    <p data-start="861.80" data-end="890.12">「兔子得走了，」小熊維尼說。「我想他突然想起有事要做。」 「那小豬呢？」 「我想小豬也是突然想到什麼事了。」 「那我們該回家了，」袋鼠媽媽說。「再見，小熊維尼。」說完，她三大步就消失了。小熊維尼看著她離去的背影。</p>
    <p data-start="891.76" data-end="920.78">"I wish I could jump like that," he thought. "Some can and some can't. That's how it is." But there were moments when Piglet wished that Kanga couldn't. Often, when he had had a long walk home through the Forest, he had wished that he were a bird; but now he thought jerkily to himself at the bottom of Kanga's pocket, this take</p>
    <p data-start="891.76" data-end="920.78">「我希望我也能那樣跳，」他想。「有些人能，有些人不能。就是這樣。」但有時候，小豬希望袋鼠媽媽不能那樣跳。經常在他走完一段長長的森林路回家後，他希望自己是一隻鳥；但現在他在袋鼠媽媽的口袋底部顛簸著想，</p>
    <p data-start="921.62" data-end="950.82">"If is shall really to flying I never it." And as he went up in the air he said, "Ooooooo!" and as he came down he said, "Ow!" And he was saying, "Ooooooo-ow, ooooooo-ow, ooooooo-ow" all the way to Kanga's house. Of course as soon as Kanga unbuttoned her pocket,</p>
    <p data-start="921.62" data-end="950.82">「如果這真的是飛，我永遠不會。」當他飛上天時，他喊道：「喔——！」當他掉下來時，他喊道：「哎喲！」於是一路上他不停地喊著「喔——哎喲，喔——哎喲，喔——哎喲」到了袋鼠媽媽的家。當然，袋鼠媽媽一解開她的口袋，</p>
    <p data-start="950.84" data-end="956.82">she saw what had happened. Just for a moment, she thought she was frightened, and then she knew she wasn't:</p>
    <p data-start="950.84" data-end="956.82">她就看到了發生了什麼。剎那間，她以為自己很害怕，但隨即她知道自己並不害怕：</p>
    <p data-start="957.46" data-end="963.72">for she felt quite sure that Christopher Robin could never let any harm happen to Roo. So she said to herself,</p>
    <p data-start="957.46" data-end="963.72">因為她很確信克里斯多福·羅賓不會讓小袋鼠遇到任何危險。於是她對自己說，</p>
    <p data-start="964.82" data-end="975.20">"If they are having a joke with me, I will have a joke with them." "Now then, Roo, dear," she said, as she took Piglet out of her pocket. "Bed-time."</p>
    <p data-start="964.82" data-end="975.20">「如果他們在跟我開玩笑，那我也要跟他們開個玩笑。」 「好了，小袋鼠，親愛的，」她說，一邊把小豬從口袋裡拿出來。「該睡覺了。」</p>
    <p data-start="976.04" data-end="1005.82">"Aha!" said Piglet, as well as he could after his Terrifying Journey. But it wasn't a very good "Aha!" and Kanga didn't seem to understand what it meant. "Bath first," said Kanga in a cheerful voice. "Aha!" said Piglet again, looking round anxiously for the others. But the others weren't there. Rabbit was playing with Baby Roo in his own house,</p>
    <p data-start="976.04" data-end="1005.82">「啊哈！」小豬說，這是他在經歷了一次可怕的旅程後所能發出的最好聲音。但這聲「啊哈！」不是很有氣勢，而袋鼠媽媽似乎也沒明白它的意思。 「先洗澡，」袋鼠媽媽快樂地說。 「啊哈！」小豬又說了一聲，焦急地四處張望尋找其他人。但其他人都不在。兔子在自己家裡和小袋鼠玩耍，</p>
    <p data-start="1005.84" data-end="1013.56">and feeling more fond of him every minute, and Pooh, who had decided to be a Kanga, was still at the sandy place on the top of the Forest,</p>
    <p data-start="1005.84" data-end="1013.56">而且每一分鐘都越來越喜歡他的兔子，小熊維尼決定當一隻袋鼠，他還在森林頂部的沙地練習跳躍。</p>
    <p data-start="1013.56" data-end="1021.80">practicing jumps. "I am not at all sure," said Kanga in a thoughtful voice,</p>
    <p data-start="1013.56" data-end="1021.80">「我不太確定，」袋鼠媽媽用思考的語氣說，</p>
    <p data-start="1021.80" data-end="1030.62">"that it wouldn't be a good idea to have a cold bath this evening. Would you like that, Roo, dear?" Piglet,</p>
    <p data-start="1021.80" data-end="1030.62">「今晚洗個冷水澡應該是個好主意。你喜歡這樣嗎，小袋鼠，親愛的？」 小豬，</p>
    <p data-start="1030.64" data-end="1060.54">who had never been really fond of baths, shuddered a long indignant shudder, and said in as brave a voice as he could: "Kanga, I see that the time has come to speak plainly." "Funny little Roo," said Kanga, as she got the bath-water ready. "I am not Roo," said Piglet loudly. "I am Piglet!" "Yes, dear, yes," said Kanga soothingly.</p>
    <p data-start="1030.64" data-end="1060.54">他從來不喜歡洗澡，因為不滿而全身顫抖，然後用他能發出的最勇敢的聲音說：「袋鼠媽媽，我覺得現在是時候說清楚了。」 「好可愛的小袋鼠，」袋鼠媽媽說，一邊準備洗澡水。「我不是小袋鼠，」小豬大聲說。「我是小豬！」 「是的，親愛的，是的，」袋鼠媽媽安撫地說。</p>
    <p data-start="1061.20" data-end="1075.08">"And imitating Piglet's voice too! So clever of him," she went on, as she took a large bar of yellow soap out of the cupboard. "What will he be doing next" "Can't you see?"</p>
    <p data-start="1061.20" data-end="1075.08">「還在模仿小豬的聲音！他真聰明，」她說著，從櫥櫃裡拿出了一大塊黃色肥皂。「他接下來會做什麼呢？」 「你看不見嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="1075.46" data-end="1088.64">shouted Piglet "Haven't you got eyes? Look at me!" "I am looking, Roo, dear," said Kanga rather severely. "And you know what I told you yesterday about making faces.</p>
    <p data-start="1075.46" data-end="1088.64">小豬喊道：「你沒有眼睛嗎？看看我！」 「我正在看呢，小袋鼠，親愛的，」袋鼠媽媽相當嚴厲地說。「你記得我昨天告訴你的不要做鬼臉的事嗎。</p>
    <p data-start="1089.44" data-end="1112.74">If you go on making faces like Piglet's, you will grow up to look like Piglet--and then think how sorry you will be. Now then, into the bath, and don't let me have to speak to you about it again." Before he knew where he was, Piglet was in the bath, and Kanga was scrubbing him firmly with a large lathery flannel.</p>
    <p data-start="1089.44" data-end="1112.74">如果你繼續做像小豬那樣的鬼臉，你長大後就會像小豬一樣——到那時你會有多後悔。好了，進去洗澡，不要讓我再說第二次。」 還沒搞清楚發生了什麼，小豬已經被放進了浴缸，袋鼠媽媽用大大的肥皂泡布狠狠地擦洗他。</p>
    <p data-start="1113.80" data-end="1143.74">"Ow!" cried Piglet. "Let me out! I'm Piglet!" "Don't open the mouth, dear, or the soap goes in," said Kanga. "There! What did I tell you?" "You--you--you did it on purpose," spluttered Piglet, as soon as he could speak again . . . and then accidentally had another mouthful of lathery flannel. "That's right, dear, don't say anything,"</p>
    <p data-start="1113.80" data-end="1143.74">「哎呦！」小豬喊道。「放我出去！我是小豬！」 「不要張嘴，親愛的，否則肥皂會進去，」袋鼠媽媽說。「看吧！我說過什麼？」 「你——你——你是故意的，」小豬結結巴巴地說，一說完又不小心吃了一大口肥皂泡布。「沒錯，親愛的，不要再說什麼了，」</p>
    <p data-start="1143.88" data-end="1155.94">said Kanga, and in another minute Piglet was out of the bath, and being rubbed dry with a towel. "Now," said Kanga, "there's your medicine, and then bed."</p>
    <p data-start="1143.88" data-end="1155.94">袋鼠媽媽說著，過了一分鐘，小豬就被從浴缸裡拉了出來，用毛巾擦乾。「好了，」袋鼠媽媽說，「現在該吃藥了，然後上床睡覺。」</p>
    <p data-start="1157.30" data-end="1167.78">"W-w-what medicine?" said Piglet. "To make you grow big and strong, dear. You don't want to grow up small and weak like Piglet, do you? Well, then!"</p>
    <p data-start="1157.30" data-end="1167.78">「什麼藥？」小豬問。「讓你長得又高又壯的藥，親愛的。你不想長得像小豬一樣又小又弱吧？那就乖乖吃藥！」</p>
    <p data-start="1169.36" data-end="1176.30">At that moment there was a knock at the door. "Come in," said Kanga, and in came Christopher Robin.</p>
    <p data-start="1169.36" data-end="1176.30">就在那時，門外傳來敲門聲。「進來，」袋鼠媽媽說，克里斯多福·羅賓走了進來。</p>
    <p data-start="1179.68" data-end="1189.42">"Christopher Robin, Christopher Robin!" cried Piglet. "Tell Kanga who I am! She keeps saying I'm Roo. I'm not Roo, am I?"</p>
    <p data-start="1179.68" data-end="1189.42">「克里斯多福·羅賓，克里斯多福·羅賓！」小豬叫道。「告訴袋鼠媽媽我是誰！她一直說我是小袋鼠。我不是小袋鼠，對吧？」</p>
    <p data-start="1190.80" data-end="1197.70">Christopher Robin looked at him very carefully, and shook his head. "You can't be Roo," he said,</p>
    <p data-start="1190.80" data-end="1197.70">克里斯多福·羅賓仔細地看著他，搖了搖頭。「你不可能是小袋鼠，」他說，</p>
    <p data-start="1197.80" data-end="1227.76">"because I've just seen Roo playing in Rabbit's house." "Well!" said Kanga. "Fancy that! Fancy my making a mistake like that." "There you are!" said Piglet. "I told you so. I'm Piglet." Christopher Robin shook his head again. "Oh, you're not Piglet," he said. "I know Piglet well, and he's quite a different colour." Piglet began to say that this was because he had just had a bath,</p>
    <p data-start="1197.80" data-end="1227.76">「因為我剛剛看到小袋鼠在兔子的家裡玩。」 「天哪！」袋鼠媽媽說。「真奇怪！我竟然犯了這樣的錯誤。」 「看吧！」小豬說。「我就說我是小豬。」 克里斯多福·羅賓又搖了搖頭。「哦，你不是小豬，」他說。「我認識小豬，而且他顏色完全不一樣。」 小豬剛想說這是因為他剛剛洗了澡，</p>
    <p data-start="1227.96" data-end="1256.72">and then he thought that perhaps he wouldn't say that, and as he opened his mouth to say something else, Kanga slipped the medicine spoon in, and then patted him on the back and told him that it was really quite a nice taste when you got used to it. "I knew it wasn't Piglet," said Kanga. "I wonder who it can be." "Perhaps it's some relation of Pooh's," said Christopher Robin. "What about a nephew or an uncle or something?"</p>
    <p data-start="1227.96" data-end="1256.72">但他想或許還是不要這麼說好了。當他張口想說別的時，袋鼠媽媽把藥匙塞進他嘴裡，然後拍拍他的背告訴他其實習慣了味道還挺好的。 「我就知道這不是小豬，」袋鼠媽媽說。「我想知道這到底是誰。」 「也許他是小熊維尼的親戚，」克里斯多福·羅賓說。「像是侄子或叔叔之類的？」</p>
    <p data-start="1258.22" data-end="1264.04">Kanga agreed that this was probably what it was, and said that they would have to call it by some name.</p>
    <p data-start="1258.22" data-end="1264.04">袋鼠媽媽同意這可能就是事實，並說他們必須給他取個名字。</p>
    <p data-start="1265.72" data-end="1283.04">"I shall call it Pootel," said Christopher Robin. "Henry Pootel for short." And just when it was decided, Henry Pootel wriggled out of Kanga's arms and jumped to the ground. To his great joy Christopher Robin had left the door open.</p>
    <p data-start="1265.72" data-end="1283.04">「我叫他普特爾，」克里斯多福·羅賓說。「簡稱亨利·普特爾。」 就在名字決定的那一刻，亨利·普特爾從袋鼠媽媽的懷裡掙脫出來，跳到地上。令他萬分高興的是，克里斯多福·羅賓沒有關上門。</p>
    <p data-start="1284.26" data-end="1313.16">Never had Henry Pootel Piglet run so fast as he ran then, and he didn't stop running until he had got quite close to his house. But when he was a hundred yards away he stopped running, and rolled the rest of the way home, so as to get his own nice comfortable colour again. So Kanga and Roo stayed in the Forest. And every Tuesday Roo spent the day with his great friend Rabbit,</p>
    <p data-start="1284.26" data-end="1313.16">亨利·普特爾小豬從未跑得像現在這麼快，他不停地跑，直到離家很近了才停下來。但是當他離家還有一百碼時，他停了下來，滾回了家，這樣他就能恢復自己那舒適的顏色。於是袋鼠媽媽和小袋鼠留在了森林裡。每個星期二，小袋鼠都會和他最好的朋友兔子一起度過一天，</p>
    <p data-start="1313.18" data-end="1319.18">and every Tuesday Kanga spent the day with her great friend Pooh, teaching him to jump,</p>
    <p data-start="1313.18" data-end="1319.18">而每個星期二，袋鼠媽媽都會和她最好的朋友小熊維尼一起度過一天，教他跳躍，</p>
    <p data-start="1319.28" data-end="1324.76">and every Tuesday Piglet spent the day with his great friend Christopher Robin. So they were all happy again.</p>
    <p data-start="1319.28" data-end="1324.76">而每個星期二，小豬都會和他最好的朋友克里斯多福·羅賓度過一天。所以他們又都快樂了起來。</p>
