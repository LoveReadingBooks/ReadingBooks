    <p data-start="0.46" data-end="5.96" style="margin-left: 35%;">第三章</p>
    <p data-start="7.60" data-end="13.38">...IN WHICH POOH AND PIGLET GO HUNTING AND NEARLY CATCH A WOOZLE</p>
    <p data-start="7.60" data-end="13.38">...在這一章中，維尼和小豬去打獵，差點抓到一隻怪獸</p>
    <p data-start="16.68" data-end="34.96">The Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beech-tree, and the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet lived in the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of broken board which had: "TRESPASSERS W" on it.</p>
    <p data-start="16.68" data-end="34.96">小豬住在一棵非常高大的山毛櫸樹中央的豪宅裡，而那棵山毛櫸樹位於森林中央，而小豬住在房子的中央。他的房子旁邊有一塊破舊的木板，上面寫著：「擅闖者W」。</p>
    <p data-start="35.36" data-end="67.72">When Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather's name, and had been in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said you couldn't be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will, which was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost one—Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.</p>
    <p data-start="35.36" data-end="67.72">當克里斯多福·羅賓問小豬那是什麼意思時，小豬說那是他祖父的名字，而且這個名字已經傳承很久了。克里斯多福·羅賓說，不可能有人叫擅闖者W，而小豬說，有的，因為他祖父就是，這是擅闖者威爾的縮寫，而擅闖者威爾又是擅闖者威廉的縮寫。他的祖父有兩個名字，以防丟掉一個——擅闖者是取自一位叔叔的名字，威廉是取自擅闖者的名字。</p>
    <p data-start="69.50" data-end="72.18">"I've got two names," said Christopher Robin carelessly.</p>
    <p data-start="69.50" data-end="72.18">「我也有兩個名字。」克里斯多福·羅賓隨意地說道。</p>
    <p data-start="73.96" data-end="76.78">"Well, there you are, that proves it," said Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="73.96" data-end="76.78">「看吧，這就證明了。」小豬說。</p>
    <p data-start="78.24" data-end="94.52">One fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh was walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else, and when Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.</p>
    <p data-start="78.24" data-end="94.52">在一個晴朗的冬日，小豬正在他房子前掃雪，突然抬頭一看，發現小熊維尼在那裡。維尼正繞著圈子走來走去，心裡想著別的事情，當小豬叫他時，他依然繼續走著。</p>
    <p data-start="95.00" data-end="109.89">"Hallo!" said Piglet, "what are you doing?" "Hunting," said Pooh. "Hunting what?" "Tracking something," said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously.</p>
    <p data-start="95.00" data-end="109.89">「哈囉！」小豬說，「你在做什麼？」「狩獵，」小熊維尼說。「狩獵什麼？」 「追蹤某物，」小熊維尼非常神秘地說。</p>
    <p data-start="109.90" data-end="118.11">"Tracking what?" said Piglet, coming closer. "That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?"</p>
    <p data-start="109.90" data-end="118.11">「追蹤什麼？」小豬走近時問道。「這正是我問自己的問題。我問自己，什麼？」</p>
    <p data-start="118.12" data-end="148.65">"What do you think you'll answer?""I shall have to wait until I catch up with it," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "Now, look there." He pointed to the ground in front of him. "What do you see there?""Tracks," said Piglet. "Paw-marks." He gave a little squeak of excitement. "Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a—a—a Woozle?"</p>
    <p data-start="118.12" data-end="148.65">「你覺得你會回答什麼呢？」「我得等到我追上它的時候再說。」小熊維尼說道。「現在，看那裡。」他指著他前面的地面。「你在那裡看到了什麼？」「腳印，」小豬說。「爪痕。」他興奮地發出一聲輕叫。「哦，維尼！你覺得那是——是——是隻吳梳嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="148.66" data-end="163.59">"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You never can tell with paw-marks." With these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him for a minute or two, ran after him.</p>
    <p data-start="148.66" data-end="163.59">「有時是，有時不是。你永遠無法確定爪印的來源。」說完這幾句話後，他繼續追蹤著，小豬看了他一兩分鐘後，也跑著跟了上去。</p>
    <p data-start="163.60" data-end="170.90">Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden stop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way. "What's the matter?" asked Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="163.60" data-end="170.90">小熊維尼突然停了下來，並困惑地彎下腰去研究那些痕跡。「怎麼了？」小豬問道。</p>
    <p data-start="171.70" data-end="198.34">"It's a very funny thing," said Bear, "but there seem to be two animals now. This—whatever-it-was—has been joined by another—whatever-it-is—and the two of them are now proceeding in company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals?"</p>
    <p data-start="171.70" data-end="198.34">「這真是件奇怪的事，」小熊說，「但似乎現在有兩隻動物了。不管這是什麼，另一個什麼也加入了它們，現在他們倆一起前進了。小豬，你能陪我一起去嗎，以防他們是敵對動物？」</p>
    <p data-start="199.82" data-end="208.36">Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had nothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it really was a Woozle.</p>
    <p data-start="199.82" data-end="208.36">小豬很有禮貌地抓了抓耳朵，說他直到星期五都沒事做，並很高興能去，萬一那真的是一隻怪獸。</p>
    <p data-start="210.64" data-end="221.84">"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles," said Winnie-the-Pooh, and Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they went together.</p>
    <p data-start="210.64" data-end="221.84">「你是說，萬一那真的是兩隻怪獸，」小熊維尼說，小豬說反正他到星期五之前沒事做。於是他們一起出發了。</p>
    <p data-start="224.62" data-end="252.56">There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this spinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,</p>
    <p data-start="224.62" data-end="252.56">這裡有一小片落葉松林，似乎這兩隻怪獸，假如真的是怪獸的話，已經繞著這片林地走過了；於是小熊和小豬也跟著繞著林地追蹤牠們。小豬一邊跟小熊說他祖父「擅闖者W」在追蹤後如何去除僵硬，以及他祖父「擅闖者W」在晚年如何受短氣之苦，</p>
    <p data-start="252.94" data-end="271.56">and other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was like, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and, if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and what Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front of them....</p>
    <p data-start="252.94" data-end="271.56">還說了一些其他有趣的事情，而小熊則在想祖父是什麼樣子，現在他們是否在追蹤兩位祖父，如果是的話，他是否可以帶一位回家並保留它，以及克里斯多福·羅賓會怎麼說。而那些痕跡依然在他們前方延續……</p>
    <p data-start="272.64" data-end="287.00">Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him. "Look!" "What?" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an exercising sort of way.</p>
    <p data-start="272.64" data-end="287.00">突然間，小熊維尼停了下來，激動地指著他面前。「看！」「什麼？」小豬嚇了一跳，說道。然後，為了顯示自己並沒有被嚇到，他又上下跳了幾下，就像在做運動一樣。</p>
    <p data-start="288.24" data-end="317.60">"The tracks!" said Pooh. "A third animal has joined the other two!" "Pooh!" cried Piglet. "Do you think it is another Woozle?" "No," said Pooh, "because it makes different marks. It is either Two Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is, Woozle.</p>
    <p data-start="288.24" data-end="317.60">「這些痕跡！」小熊說。「第三隻動物加入了其他兩隻！」「維尼！」小豬喊道。「你覺得那是另一隻吳梳嗎？」「不，」維尼說，「因為它留下的痕跡不一樣。這可能是兩隻吳梳和一隻，也許是，威梭，或者是兩隻，也許是，威梭和一隻，如果是的話，吳梳。」</p>
    <p data-start="318.98" data-end="344.60">Let us continue to follow them." So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very much that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so much.</p>
    <p data-start="318.98" data-end="344.60">讓我們繼續跟蹤他們吧。」於是他們繼續走著，現在感到有點不安，擔心前面的三隻動物可能懷有敵意。小豬非常希望他的祖父T.W.在這裡，而不是在別的地方；維尼則想著，如果他們能突然又意外地遇見羅賓，該有多好啊，僅僅因為他非常喜歡羅賓。</p>
    <p data-start="346.36" data-end="360.60">And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before. There were four animals in front of them!</p>
    <p data-start="346.36" data-end="360.60">然後，小熊維尼又突然停了下來，涼爽地舔了舔鼻尖，因為他感到比以往任何時候都更加焦躁和不安。現在他們面前有四隻動物了！</p>
    <p data-start="361.56" data-end="372.76">"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle.</p>
    <p data-start="361.56" data-end="372.76">「你看到了嗎，小豬？看看他們的痕跡！就像是三隻怪獸，還有一隻，就像是，一隻威茲獸。」</p>
    <p data-start="372.98" data-end="387.74">Another Woozle has joined them!" And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other here, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.</p>
    <p data-start="372.98" data-end="387.74">「另一隻怪獸也加入他們了！」看起來確實如此。那裡有腳印；有些地方互相交錯，有些地方混在一起；但很明顯的是，時不時地可以看到四組爪印。</p>
    <p data-start="387.82" data-end="407.82">"I think," said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too, and found that it brought very little comfort, "I think that I have just remembered something. I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now."</p>
    <p data-start="387.82" data-end="407.82">「我想，」小豬說，當他也舔了舔鼻尖後，發現這並沒有帶來多少安慰，「我想我剛剛想起了一件事。我剛剛想起了一件我昨天忘了做的事情，而明天也不能做。所以我想我現在真的應該回去做這件事。」「大約十二點，」小熊維尼看著太陽說。「就像我剛才說的，大約在十二點到十二點零五之間。所以，其實，親愛的老維尼，如果你能原諒我——那是什麼？」</p>
    <p data-start="408.02" data-end="414.68">"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you," said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="408.02" data-end="414.68">「我們下午再做吧，我會陪你一起去。」小熊說。</p>
    <p data-start="416.28" data-end="441.64">"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon," said Piglet quickly. "It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in the morning, and, if possible, between the hours of——What would you say the time was?" "About twelve," said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun. "Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So, really, dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me——What's that?"</p>
    <p data-start="416.28" data-end="441.64">「這不是那種可以在下午做的事情，」小豬急忙說道。「這是一件必須在早上做的非常特殊的事情，如果可能的話，最好是在——你說現在幾點了？」</p>
    <p data-start="442.52" data-end="468.78">Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he looked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his. "It's Christopher Robin," he said. "Ah, then you'll be all right," said Piglet. "You'll be quite safe with him. Good-bye," and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very glad to be Out of All Danger again.</p>
    <p data-start="442.52" data-end="468.78">小熊抬頭看了看天空，然後聽到又一聲口哨，他抬頭看向一棵大橡樹的樹枝上，然後看到了他的朋友。「是羅賓，」他說。「啊，那你就沒事了，」小豬說。「和他在一起你會很安全的。再見。」然後他飛快地跑回家，心裡非常高興自己再次脫離了所有危險。</p>
    <p data-start="471.06" data-end="488.82">Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree. "Silly old Bear," he said, "what were you doing? First you went round the spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you went round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth time——"</p>
    <p data-start="471.06" data-end="488.82">克里斯多福·羅賓慢慢地從樹上下來。「傻老熊，」他說，「你在做什麼呢？你先是自己繞著小樹林轉了兩圈，然後小豬跟著你一起轉，又轉了一圈，然後你們正要繞第四圈——」</p>
    <p data-start="489.04" data-end="518.76">"Wait a moment," said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw. He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his nose twice, and stood up. "Yes," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "I see now," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "I have been Foolish and Deluded," said he, "and I am a Bear of No Brain at All."</p>
    <p data-start="489.04" data-end="518.76">「等一下，」小熊維尼舉起他的爪子說道。他坐下來，盡可能地深思熟慮。接著，他把爪子放進其中一個腳印裡……然後，他揉了揉鼻子兩次，站了起來。「是的，」小熊維尼說。「我現在明白了，」小熊維尼說。「我一直很愚蠢和被迷惑了，」他說，「我真的是一隻完全沒有智慧的熊。」</p>
    <p data-start="518.86" data-end="525.28">"You're the Best Bear in All the World," said Christopher Robin soothingly.</p>
    <p data-start="518.86" data-end="525.28">「你是全世界最棒的小熊。」克里斯多福·羅賓安撫地說道。</p>
    <p data-start="526.40" data-end="530.10">"Am I?" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened up suddenly.</p>
    <p data-start="526.40" data-end="530.10">「是嗎？」小熊充滿希望地說。然後他突然精神起來。</p>
    <p data-start="531.64" data-end="541.32">"Anyhow," he said, "it is nearly Luncheon Time." So he went home for it.</p>
    <p data-start="531.64" data-end="541.32">「無論如何，」他說，「差不多到了午餐時間了。」所以他回家去吃午餐了。</p>
