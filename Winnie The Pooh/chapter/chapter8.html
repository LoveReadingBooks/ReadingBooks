    <p data-start="9.60" data-end="14.76">...IN WHICH CHRISTOPHER ROBIN LEADS AN EXPOTITION TO THE NORTH POLE</p>
    <p data-start="9.60" data-end="14.76">...在這一章中，克里斯多夫‧羅賓帶領大家去北極探險</p>
    <p data-start="17.02" data-end="24.36">ONE fine day Pooh had stumped up to the top of the Forest to see if his friend Christopher Robin was interested in Bears at all.</p>
    <p data-start="17.02" data-end="24.36">有一天，普熊慢吞吞地走到森林的頂端，想看看他的朋友克里斯多夫‧羅賓對熊有沒有興趣。</p>
    <p data-start="25.00" data-end="34.74">At breakfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two) he had suddenly thought of a new song. It began like this:</p>
    <p data-start="25.00" data-end="34.74">那天早餐時（簡單的一餐，薄薄地塗了橘子醬在一兩個蜂巢上），他突然想到了一首新歌。歌詞是這樣開始的：</p>
    <p data-start="36.46" data-end="39.52">"Sing Ho! For the life of a Bear."</p>
    <p data-start="36.46" data-end="39.52">「唱吧！為熊的生活而唱。」</p>
    <p data-start="41.16" data-end="44.60">When he had got as far as this, he scratched his head, and thought to himself</p>
    <p data-start="41.16" data-end="44.60">當他唱到這裡時，他抓了抓頭，心裡想</p>
    <p data-start="45.54" data-end="51.66">"That's a very good start for a song, but what about the second line?"</p>
    <p data-start="45.54" data-end="51.66">「這是首歌的很好開頭，但第二句該怎麼接呢？」</p>
    <p data-start="52.72" data-end="66.66">He tried singing "Ho," two or three times, but it didn't seem to help. "Perhaps it would be better," he thought, "if I sang Hi for the life of a Bear."</p>
    <p data-start="52.72" data-end="66.66">他試著唱了兩三次「唱吧」，但似乎沒什麼幫助。「或許，如果我唱『嗨，為熊的生活而唱』會更好些。」他想。</p>
    <p data-start="67.96" data-end="80.98">So he sang it . . . but it wasn't. "Very well, then," he said, "I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I sing it very quickly,</p>
    <p data-start="67.96" data-end="80.98">於是他這麼唱了……但效果不好。「那好吧，」他說，「我就唱第一句兩次，或許我唱得很快的話，</p>
    <p data-start="81.00" data-end="110.90">I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines before I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song. Now then:" Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear! Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear! I don't much mind if it rains or snows, 'Cos I've got a lot of honey on my nice new nose!</p>
    <p data-start="81.00" data-end="110.90">在我來不及想到第三和第四句之前，我就已經唱了出來，那樣就會是一首好歌。那麼現在開始吧：唱吧！為熊的生活而唱！唱吧！為熊的生活而唱！我不太在乎是下雨還是下雪，因為我的漂亮新鼻子上有很多蜂蜜！</p>
    <p data-start="111.78" data-end="136.72">I don't much care if it snows or thaws, 'Cos I've got a lot of honey on my nice clean paws! Sing Ho! for a Bear! Sing Ho! for a Pooh! And I'll have a little something in an hour or two! He was so pleased with this song that he sang it all the way to the top of the Forest,</p>
    <p data-start="111.78" data-end="136.72">我不太在乎是下雪還是融雪，因為我的乾淨新爪子上有很多蜂蜜！唱吧！為熊而唱！唱吧！為普熊而唱！一兩個小時後我會再吃點東西！他對這首歌非常滿意，於是一路唱到了森林的頂端，</p>
    <p data-start="137.48" data-end="152.38">"and if I go on singing it much longer," he thought, "it will be time for the little something, and then the last line won't be true." So he turned it into a hum instead.</p>
    <p data-start="137.48" data-end="152.38">「如果我再繼續唱下去，」他想，「就該是吃點東西的時候了，那麼最後一句就不會是真的了。」於是他將歌變成了哼唱。</p>
    <p data-start="154.86" data-end="165.76">Christopher Robin was sitting outside his door, putting on his Big Boots. As soon as he saw the Big Boots, Pooh knew that an Adventure was going to happen,</p>
    <p data-start="154.86" data-end="165.76">克里斯多夫‧羅賓坐在門外，穿上他的大靴子。一看到大靴子，普熊就知道將有一次冒險要發生，</p>
    <p data-start="166.32" data-end="175.90">and he brushed the honey off his nose with the back of his paw, and spruced himself up as well as he could, so as to look Ready for Anything.</p>
    <p data-start="166.32" data-end="175.90">他用爪子的背面把鼻子上的蜂蜜擦掉，儘可能地整理好自己，讓自己看起來隨時準備好迎接任何挑戰。</p>
    <p data-start="177.84" data-end="187.12">"Good morning, Christopher Robin," he called out. "Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can't get this boot on." "That's bad," said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="177.84" data-end="187.12">「早安，克里斯多夫‧羅賓，」他叫道。「哈囉，普熊。我這靴子穿不上去。」普熊說：「那可不好。」</p>
    <p data-start="187.64" data-end="195.10">"Do you think you could very kindly lean against me, 'cos I keep pulling so hard that I fall over backwards."</p>
    <p data-start="187.64" data-end="195.10">「你能不能靠著我，因為我一直使勁拉，結果老是往後倒。」</p>
    <p data-start="196.10" data-end="211.14">Pooh sat down, dug his feet into the ground, and pushed hard against Christopher Robin's back, and Christopher Robin pushed hard against his, and pulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on.</p>
    <p data-start="196.10" data-end="211.14">普熊坐下來，把腳深深地埋進地裡，並用力靠在克里斯多夫‧羅賓的背上，而克里斯多夫‧羅賓也用力靠著他，拼命拉他的靴子，直到靴子穿上為止。</p>
    <p data-start="211.74" data-end="219.74">"And that's that," said Pooh. "What do we do next?" "We are all going on an Expedition,"</p>
    <p data-start="211.74" data-end="219.74">「好了，這就搞定了，」普熊說。「接下來我們做什麼？」克里斯多夫‧羅賓說：「我們要去探險了。」</p>
    <p data-start="220.30" data-end="228.74">said Christopher Robin, as he got up and brushed himself. "Thank you, Pooh." "Going on an Expotition?"</p>
    <p data-start="220.30" data-end="228.74">他站起來，拍掉身上的灰塵。「謝謝你，普熊。」普熊急切地問：「去探險嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="229.14" data-end="236.58">said Pooh eagerly. "I don't think I've ever been on one of those. Where are we going to on this Expotition?"</p>
    <p data-start="229.14" data-end="236.58">「我好像從來沒參加過那樣的活動。我們這次要去哪裡探險？」</p>
    <p data-start="237.68" data-end="260.82">"Expedition, silly old Bear. It's got an 'x' in it." "Oh!" said Pooh. "I know." But he didn't really. "We're going to discover the North Pole." "Oh!" said Pooh again. "What is the North Pole?" he asked. "It's just a thing you discover,"</p>
    <p data-start="237.68" data-end="260.82">「探險，傻熊。這個詞裡有個『x』。」普熊說：「哦！我知道了。」但他其實並不是真的知道。「我們要去發現北極。」普熊又說：「哦！」然後問：「什麼是北極？」克里斯多夫‧羅賓隨意地說：「就是一個你會發現的東西，」其實他自己也不太確定。</p>
    <p data-start="261.32" data-end="291.04">said Christopher Robin carelessly, not being quite sure himself. "Oh! I see," said Pooh. "Are bears any good at discovering it?" "Of course they are. And Rabbit and Kanga and all of you. It's an Expedition. That's what an Expedition means. A long line of everybody. You'd better tell the others to get ready, while I see if my gun's all right. And we must all bring Provisions."</p>
    <p data-start="261.32" data-end="291.04">普熊說：「哦！我明白了。熊擅長發現這東西嗎？」克里斯多夫‧羅賓說：「當然擅長。還有兔子和袋鼠媽媽以及你們所有人。這就是探險的意思。一長隊人馬。你最好去告訴其他人準備好，我去看看我的槍是否正常。我們還得帶上糧草。」</p>
    <p data-start="292.66" data-end="321.04">"Bring what?" "Things to eat." "Oh!" said Pooh happily. "I thought you said Provisions. I'll go and tell them." And he stumped off. The first person he met was Rabbit. "Hallo, Rabbit," he said, "is that you?" "Let's pretend it isn't," said Rabbit, "and see what happens." "I've got a message for you." "I'll give it to him."</p>
    <p data-start="292.66" data-end="321.04">「帶什麼？」普熊開心地說：「吃的東西。」普熊說：「哦！我還以為你說的是糧草。我這就去告訴他們。」他轉身走了。第一個遇到的是兔子。「哈囉，兔子，」他說，「是你嗎？」兔子說：「假裝不是，看看會發生什麼事吧。」普熊說：「我有個消息要告訴你。」兔子說：「那我就傳達給他吧。」</p>
    <p data-start="322.66" data-end="350.74">"We're all going on an. Expotition with Christopher Robin!" "What is it when we're on it?" "A sort of boat, I think," said Pooh. "Oh! that sort." "Yes. And we're going to discover a Pole or something. Or was it a Mole? Anyhow we're going to discover it." "We are, are we?" said Rabbit.</p>
    <p data-start="322.66" data-end="350.74">「我們都要和克里斯多夫‧羅賓一起去探險！」普熊說。「我們去探險時會怎樣？」普熊說：「我想這是一種船。」兔子說：「哦！那種啊。」普熊說：「是的。我們要去發現一根桿子或什麼的。或者是一隻鼴鼠？無論如何，我們要去發現它。」兔子說：「是嗎，我們要去嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="351.06" data-end="381.04">"Yes. And we've got to bring Pro-things to eat with us. In case we want to eat them. Now I'm going down to Piglet's. Tell Kanga, will you?" He left Rabbit and hurried down to Piglet's house. The Piglet was sitting on the ground at the door of his house blowing happily at a dandelion, and wondering whether it would be this year, next year, some time or never. He had just discovered that it would be never,</p>
    <p data-start="351.06" data-end="381.04">「是的。我們得帶上東西吃。以防我們想吃的時候有東西吃。現在我要去小豬家。你告訴袋鼠媽媽，好嗎？」他離開了兔子，匆匆趕到小豬家。小豬正坐在他家門口的地上，快樂地吹著蒲公英，想知道是今年，明年，還是有朝一日，或者永遠不會實現。他剛剛發現那將是永遠不會，</p>
    <p data-start="381.28" data-end="398.84">and was trying to remember what "it" was, and hoping it wasn't anything nice, when Pooh came up. "Oh! Piglet," said Pooh excitedly, we're going on an Expotition, all of us, with things to eat. To discover something."</p>
    <p data-start="381.28" data-end="398.84">正努力記起「它」是什麼，希望那不會是什麼美好的事情，這時普熊走了過來。「哦！小豬，」普熊興奮地說，「我們要去探險，大家一起，帶著吃的東西。去發現某些東西。」</p>
    <p data-start="400.48" data-end="429.00">"To discover what?" said Piglet anxiously. "Oh! just something." "Nothing fierce?" "Christopher Robin didn't say anything about fierce. He just said it had an 'x'." "It isn't their necks I mind," said Piglet earnestly. "It's their teeth. But if Christopher Robin is coming I don't mind anything."</p>
    <p data-start="400.48" data-end="429.00">小豬焦慮地問：「去發現什麼？」普熊說：「哦！只是某些東西。」小豬說：「不會是什麼兇猛的東西吧？」普熊說：「克里斯多夫‧羅賓沒有說什麼兇猛的東西。他只是說那個東西裡有個『x』。」小豬認真地說：「我不介意他們的脖子，介意的是他們的牙齒。不過如果克里斯多夫‧羅賓也去，那我什麼都不怕了。」</p>
    <p data-start="429.06" data-end="440.06">In a little while they were all ready at the top of the Forest, and the Expotition started. First came Christopher Robin and Rabbit, then Piglet and Pooh;</p>
    <p data-start="429.06" data-end="440.06">沒過多久，他們都在森林的頂端準備好了，探險開始了。首先是克里斯多夫
    <p data-start="440.32" data-end="448.72">ther Kanga, with Roo in her pocket, and Owl; then Eeyore; and, at the end, in a long line, all Rabbit's friends-and-relations.</p>
    <p data-start="440.32" data-end="448.72">還有袋鼠媽媽，口袋裡有小袋子，和貓頭鷹；然後是驢子；最後是一長排兔子所有的朋友和親戚們。</p>
    <p data-start="451.90" data-end="458.40">"I didn't ask them," explained Rabbit carelessly. "They just came. They always do.</p>
    <p data-start="451.90" data-end="458.40">「我沒有邀請他們來的，」兔子漫不經心地解釋說。「他們只是來了。他們總是這樣。</p>
    <p data-start="458.42" data-end="470.28">They can march at the end, after Eeyore." "What I say," said Eeyore, "is that it's unsettling. I didn't want to come on this Expo--what Pooh said.</p>
    <p data-start="458.42" data-end="470.28">他們可以走在最後，跟在驢子後面。」 「我想說的是，」驢子說，「這讓人心神不寧。我不想來這次探險——小熊維尼說的那個。</p>
    <p data-start="470.32" data-end="484.72">I only came to oblige. But here I am; and if I am the end of the Expo--</p>
    <p data-start="470.32" data-end="484.72">我只是來給個面子。但是我來了；如果我是這次探險的結尾——</p>
    <p data-start="485.00" data-end="497.18">what we're talking about--then let me be the end. But if, every time I want to sit down for a little rest,</p>
    <p data-start="485.00" data-end="497.18">我們正在談論的——那麼就讓我做個結尾吧。但如果每次我想坐下來休息一下，</p>
    <p data-start="497.48" data-end="507.94">I have to brush away half a dozen of Rabbit's smaller friends-and-relations first, then this isn't an Expo--whatever it is--at all,</p>
    <p data-start="497.48" data-end="507.94">我都得先把半打兔子的小朋友和親戚趕走，那麼這根本就不是一個探險——無論它是什麼——</p>
    <p data-start="508.40" data-end="522.56">it's simply a Confused Noise. That's what I say." "I see what Eeyore means," said Owl. "If you ask me--" "I'm not asking anybody,"</p>
    <p data-start="508.40" data-end="522.56">而只是一個混亂的噪音。這就是我的看法。" "我明白驢子說的意思了，"貓頭鷹說。"如果你問我——" "我沒有問任何人，"</p>
    <p data-start="523.50" data-end="537.64">said Eeyore. "I'm just telling everybody. We can look for the North Pole, or we can play 'Here we go gathering Nuts and May' with the end part of an ants' nest.</p>
    <p data-start="523.50" data-end="537.64">驢子說。"我只是告訴大家。我們可以去尋找北極，或者我們也可以和一群螞蟻的巢穴末端玩 '我們去採集堅果和五月花'。</p>
    <p data-start="537.66" data-end="548.48">It's all the same to me." There was a shout from the top of the line.</p>
    <p data-start="537.66" data-end="548.48">對我來說，這都是一樣的。" 前面傳來了一聲喊叫。</p>
    <p data-start="548.80" data-end="558.04">"Come on!" called Christopher Robin. "Come on!" called Owl. "We're starting," said Rabbit. "I must go."</p>
    <p data-start="548.80" data-end="558.04">"快來！"克里斯多夫·羅賓喊道。"快來！"貓頭鷹也喊道。"我們要出發了，"兔子說。"我得走了。"</p>
    <p data-start="558.66" data-end="562.34">And he hurried off to the front of the Expotition with Christopher Robin.</p>
    <p data-start="558.66" data-end="562.34">然後他趕快跑到探險隊的前面，跟克里斯多夫·羅賓在一起。</p>
    <p data-start="564.42" data-end="592.36">"All right," said Eeyore. "We're going. Only Don't Blame Me." So off they all went to discover the Pole. And as they walked, they chattered to each other of this and that, all except Pooh, who was making up a song. "This is the first verse," he said to Piglet, when he was ready with it. "First verse of what?" "My song." "What song?"</p>
    <p data-start="564.42" data-end="592.36">"好吧，"驢子說。"我們出發了。只是不要怪我。" 於是他們全都出發去發現北極。在他們行走的時候，大家有說有笑，除了小熊維尼，他正在編一首歌。"這是第一段，"他對小豬說，當他準備好時。"第一段什麼？" "我的歌。" "什麼歌？"</p>
    <p data-start="593.14" data-end="621.36">"This one." "Which one?" "Well, if you listen, Piglet, you'll hear it." "How do you know I'm not listening?" Pooh couldn't answer that one, so he began to sing. They all went off to discover the Pole, Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all; It's a Thing you Discover, as I've been tole By Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all. Eeyore, Christopher Robin and Pooh</p>
    <p data-start="593.14" data-end="621.36">"這首。" "哪首？" "嗯，如果你聽的話，小豬，你會聽到的。" "你怎麼知道我沒在聽？" 小熊維尼回答不上來這個問題，所以他開始唱歌。他們全都出發去發現北極，貓頭鷹、小豬和兔子全都去了；這是一個你會發現的東西，就像貓頭鷹、小豬和兔子告訴我的那樣。驢子、克里斯多夫·羅賓和小熊維尼</p>
    <p data-start="623.26" data-end="634.28">And Rabbit's relations all went too-- And where the Pole was none of them knew.... Sing Hey! for Owl and Rabbit and all!</p>
    <p data-start="623.26" data-end="634.28">以及兔子的親戚們也都去了——但是沒有人知道北極在哪裡……唱起來吧！為了貓頭鷹、兔子和所有人！</p>
    <p data-start="635.08" data-end="641.46">"Hush!" said Christopher Robin turning round to Pooh, "we're just coming to a Dangerous Place."</p>
    <p data-start="635.08" data-end="641.46">"噓！" 克里斯多夫·羅賓轉過身對小熊維尼說，"我們就快到一個危險的地方了。"</p>
    <p data-start="642.94" data-end="645.44">"Hush!" said Pooh turning round quickly to Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="642.94" data-end="645.44">"噓！" 小熊維尼迅速轉過身對小豬說。</p>
    <p data-start="646.52" data-end="648.04">"Hush!" said Piglet to Kanga.</p>
    <p data-start="646.52" data-end="648.04">"噓！" 小豬對袋鼠媽媽說。</p>
    <p data-start="649.10" data-end="654.26">"Hush!" said Kanga to Owl, while Roo said "Hush!" several times to himself, very quietly.</p>
    <p data-start="649.10" data-end="654.26">"噓！" 袋鼠媽媽對貓頭鷹說，而小袋鼠則對自己悄悄地說了好幾次"噓！"。</p>
    <p data-start="654.60" data-end="667.44">"Hush!" said Owl to Eeyore. "Hush!" said Eeyore in a terrible voice to all Rabbit's friends-and-relations, and "Hush!"</p>
    <p data-start="654.60" data-end="667.44">"噓！" 貓頭鷹對驢子說。"噓！" 驢子用可怕的聲音對兔子的所有朋友和親戚說，然後"噓！"</p>
    <p data-start="667.44" data-end="671.58">they said hastily to each other all down the line, until it got to the last one of all.</p>
    <p data-start="667.44" data-end="671.58">他們匆匆忙忙地互相傳遞這個聲音，直到傳到隊伍的最後一個人。</p>
    <p data-start="672.60" data-end="688.34">And the last and smallest friend-and-relation was so upset to find that the whole Expotition was saying "Hush!" to him, that he buried himself head downwards in a crack in the ground, and stayed there for two days until the danger was over,</p>
    <p data-start="672.60" data-end="688.34">而那個最後的、最小的朋友和親戚發現整個探險隊都對他說"噓！"時，他非常沮喪，以至於把自己頭朝下埋在地上的一條縫隙裡，並待了兩天直到危險過去，</p>
    <p data-start="688.86" data-end="696.18">and then went home in a great hurry, and lived quietly with his Aunt ever- afterwards. His name was Alexander Beetle.</p>
    <p data-start="688.86" data-end="696.18">然後匆忙回家，從此之後安靜地跟他的姑媽生活在一起。他的名字叫亞歷山大·甲蟲。</p>
    <p data-start="696.58" data-end="703.70">They had come to a stream which twisted and tumbled between high rocky banks,</p>
    <p data-start="696.58" data-end="703.70">他們來到了一條在高高的岩石河岸間蜿蜒奔流的小溪邊，</p>
    <p data-start="704.00" data-end="712.64">and Christopher Robin saw at once how dangerous it was. "It's just the place," he explained, "for an Ambush."</p>
    <p data-start="704.00" data-end="712.64">克里斯多夫·羅賓馬上就看出來這是多麼危險的一個地方。"這正是，"他解釋道，"適合埋伏的地方。"</p>
    <p data-start="713.72" data-end="738.86">"What sort of bush?" whispered Pooh to Piglet. "A gorse-bush?" "My dear Pooh," said Owl in his superior way, "don't you know what an Ambush is?" "Owl," said Piglet, looking round at him severely, "Pooh's whisper was a perfectly private whisper, and there was no need----" "An Ambush," said Owl, "is a sort of Surprise."</p>
    <p data-start="713.72" data-end="738.86">"什麼樣的灌木叢？" 小熊維尼對小豬悄聲問。"是金雀花叢嗎？" "親愛的小熊維尼，"貓頭鷹用他那自以為是的口氣說，"你難道不知道什麼是埋伏嗎？" "貓頭鷹，"小豬嚴厲地看著他說，"小熊維尼的悄悄話是完全私人的悄悄話，你根本沒有必要——" "埋伏，"貓頭鷹說，"是一種驚喜。"</p>
    <p data-start="740.08" data-end="749.86">"So is a gorse-bush sometimes," said Pooh. "An Ambush, as I was about to explain to Pooh," said Piglet, "is a sort of Surprise."</p>
    <p data-start="740.08" data-end="749.86">"而金雀花叢有時也是驚喜，"小熊維尼說。"埋伏，正如我剛才要向小熊維尼解釋的，"小豬說，"是一種驚喜。"</p>
    <p data-start="751.40" data-end="760.98">"If people jump out at you suddenly, that's an Ambush," said Owl. "It's an Ambush, Pooh, when people jump at you suddenly," explained Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="751.40" data-end="760.98">"如果有人突然跳出來，那就是埋伏，"貓頭鷹說。"小熊維尼，如果有人突然跳出來，那就是埋伏，"小豬解釋道。</p>
    <p data-start="762.56" data-end="775.02">Pooh, who now knew what an Ambush was, said that a gorse-bush had sprung at him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree, and he had taken six days to get all the prickles out of himself.</p>
    <p data-start="762.56" data-end="775.02">現在知道什麼是埋伏的小熊維尼說，有一天他從樹上摔下來時，一叢金雀花突然向他撲過來，他花了六天時間才把所有的刺都拔出來。</p>
    <p data-start="776.40" data-end="780.90">"We are not talking about gorse-bushes," said Owl a little crossly.</p>
    <p data-start="776.40" data-end="780.90">"我們不是在討論金雀花叢，"貓頭鷹有點生氣地說。</p>
    <p data-start="781.92" data-end="809.32">"I am," said Pooh. They were climbing very cautiously up the stream now, going from rock to rock, and after they had gone a little way they came to a place where the banks widened out at each side, so that on each side of the water there was a level strip of grass on which they could sit down and rest. As soon as he saw this, Christopher Robin called "Halt!" and they all sat down and rested.</p>
    <p data-start="781.92" data-end="809.32">"我在討論，"小熊維尼說。現在他們非常小心地沿著小溪攀登著，一塊岩石接著一塊岩石，走了一段路之後，他們來到一個兩岸逐漸擴展的地方，因此在水的兩邊各有一條可以坐下來休息的平坦草地。克里斯多夫·羅賓一看到這個地方就叫道"停！" 於是他們都坐下來休息。</p>
    <p data-start="811.90" data-end="819.74">"I think," said Christopher Robin, "that we ought to eat all our Provisions now, so that we shan't have so much to carry."</p>
    <p data-start="811.90" data-end="819.74">"我想，"克里斯多夫·羅賓說，"我們應該把所有的乾糧現在就吃光，這樣我們就不用再背著它們了。"</p>
    <p data-start="821.38" data-end="822.58">"Eat all our what?" said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="821.38" data-end="822.58">"吃光我們所有的什麼？" 小熊維尼說。</p>
    <p data-start="823.24" data-end="827.78">"All that we've brought," said Piglet, getting to work.</p>
    <p data-start="823.24" data-end="827.78">"我們帶來的所有東西，"小豬說，開始動手了。</p>
    <p data-start="828.82" data-end="838.02">"That's a good idea," said Pooh, and he got to work too. "Have you all got something?" asked Christopher Robin with his mouth full.</p>
    <p data-start="828.82" data-end="838.02">"這是個好主意，"小熊維尼說，他也開始動手了。"你們都有東西吃嗎？"克里斯多夫·羅賓一邊咀嚼著一邊問道。</p>
    <p data-start="839.26" data-end="847.12">"All except me," said Eeyore. "As Usual." He looked round at them in his melancholy way.</p>
    <p data-start="839.26" data-end="847.12">"除了我，"驢子說。"一如往常。"他用那憂鬱的眼神看著
    <p data-start="848.82" data-end="859.72">I suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any chance?" "I believe I am," said Pooh. "Ow!" He got up, and looked behind him.</p>
    <p data-start="848.82" data-end="859.72">「我想你們沒有誰正好坐在牛蒡上吧？」 「我想我正坐在上面，」小熊維尼說。「哎喲！」他站起來，往後看了一眼。</p>
    <p data-start="860.22" data-end="870.50">"Yes, I was. I thought so." "Thank you, Pooh. If you've quite finished with it."</p>
    <p data-start="860.22" data-end="870.50">「是的，我的確坐在上面。我就知道。」 「謝謝你，小熊維尼。如果你用完了它。」</p>
    <p data-start="870.66" data-end="879.38">He moved across to Pooh's place, and began to eat. "It doesn't do them any Good, you know, sitting on them," he went on, as he looked up munching.</p>
    <p data-start="870.66" data-end="879.38">他走到小熊維尼的位置，開始吃東西。「你知道，坐在上面對他們沒有什麼好處，」他一邊吃一邊抬頭說。</p>
    <p data-start="879.60" data-end="888.56">"Takes all the Life out of them. Remember that another time, all of you. A little Consideration,</p>
    <p data-start="879.60" data-end="888.56">「把它們所有的生命都奪走了。記住這一點，以後都要考慮一下，</p>
    <p data-start="889.18" data-end="897.92">a little Thought for Others, makes all the difference." As soon as he had finished his lunch Christopher Robin whispered to Rabbit,</p>
    <p data-start="889.18" data-end="897.92">多為他人想一想，這會有所不同。」克里斯多夫‧羅賓一吃完午餐，就低聲對兔子說，</p>
    <p data-start="897.92" data-end="907.58">and Rabbit said "Yes, yes, of course," and they walked a little way up the stream together.</p>
    <p data-start="897.92" data-end="907.58">兔子說：「是的，是的，當然。」然後他們一起沿著溪流走了一段路。</p>
    <p data-start="907.64" data-end="915.68">"I didn't want the others to hear," said Christopher Robin. "Quite so," said Rabbit, looking important.</p>
    <p data-start="907.64" data-end="915.68">「我不想讓其他人聽到，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓說。「當然了，」兔子看起來很重要的樣子說。</p>
    <p data-start="916.50" data-end="933.38">"It's--I wondered--It's only--Rabbit, I suppose you don't know, What does the North Pole look like?" "Well," said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers. "Now you're asking me." "I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten,"</p>
    <p data-start="916.50" data-end="933.38">「這是--我在想--這只是--兔子，我想你不知道，北極柱長什麼樣子吧？」兔子一邊撫摸著鬍鬚說：「嗯，現在你問我了。」 「我確實知道，只是我有點忘記了，」</p>
    <p data-start="934.30" data-end="963.88">said Christopher Robin carelessly. "It's a funny thing," said Rabbit, "but I've sort of forgotten too, although I did know once." "I suppose it's just a pole stuck in the ground?" "Sure to be a pole," said Rabbit, "because of calling it a pole, and if it's a pole, well, I should think it would be sticking in the ground, shouldn't you, because there'd be nowhere else to stick it." "Yes, that's what I thought."</p>
    <p data-start="934.30" data-end="963.88">克里斯多夫‧羅賓隨意地說。「這真是件有趣的事情，」兔子說，「但我也有點忘了，雖然我曾經知道。」 「我想它就是一根插在地上的柱子？」 「肯定是一根柱子，」兔子說，「因為它被叫做柱子，如果它是一根柱子，那麼我認為它應該插在地上，不是嗎，因為沒有其他地方可以插。」 「是的，這就是我所想的。」</p>
    <p data-start="965.20" data-end="980.68">"The only thing," said Rabbit, "is, where is it sticking?" "That's what we're looking for," said Christopher Robin. They went back to the others. Piglet was lying on his back, sleeping peacefully.</p>
    <p data-start="965.20" data-end="980.68">「唯一的問題是，」兔子說，「它插在哪裡呢？」 「這就是我們要找的，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓說。他們回到了其他人那裡。小豬正仰躺著，平靜地睡著。</p>
    <p data-start="980.90" data-end="991.82">Roo was washing his face and paws in the stream, while Kanga explained to everybody proudly that this was the first time he had ever washed his face himself,</p>
    <p data-start="980.90" data-end="991.82">小袋子正在溪流中洗臉和爪子，而袋鼠驕傲地向大家解釋說，這是他第一次自己洗臉，</p>
    <p data-start="992.62" data-end="1002.78">and Owl was telling Kanga an Interesting Anecdote full of long words like Encyclopedia and Rhododendron to which Kanga wasn't listening.</p>
    <p data-start="992.62" data-end="1002.78">而貓頭鷹則在對袋鼠講一個充滿長詞彙的有趣軼事，比如百科全書和杜鵑花，而袋鼠並沒有在聽。</p>
    <p data-start="1004.04" data-end="1007.88">"I don't hold with all this washing," grumbled Eeyore.</p>
    <p data-start="1004.04" data-end="1007.88">「我不贊同這些洗臉的做法，」驢子抱怨道。</p>
    <p data-start="1008.98" data-end="1033.88">"This modern Behind-the-ears nonsense. What do you think, Pooh?" "Well, said Pooh, "I think----" But we shall never know what Pooh thought, for there came a sudden squeak from Roo, a splash, and a loud cry of alarm from Kanga. "So much for washing," said Eeyore.</p>
    <p data-start="1008.98" data-end="1033.88">「這種現代的耳後清洗胡鬧行為。你怎麼看，普？」 「嗯，」普說，「我覺得----」 但我們永遠不會知道普的想法，因為突然傳來小袋子的一聲尖叫，隨後是一聲撲通，還有袋鼠的一聲驚叫。「洗臉就這麼回事，」驢子說。</p>
    <p data-start="1035.88" data-end="1041.64">"Roo's fallen in!" cried Rabbit, and he and Christopher Robin came rushing down to the rescue.</p>
    <p data-start="1035.88" data-end="1041.64">「小袋子掉進去了！」兔子喊道，他和克里斯多夫‧羅賓衝過來救援。</p>
    <p data-start="1042.76" data-end="1049.98">"Look at me swimming!" squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was hurried down a waterfall into the next pool.</p>
    <p data-start="1042.76" data-end="1049.98">「看我游泳！」小袋子從他的小水池中尖叫著，隨後被沖進了下一個水池。</p>
    <p data-start="1051.20" data-end="1057.88">"Are you all right, Roo dear?" called Kanga anxiously. "Yes!" said Roo. "Look at me sw--"</p>
    <p data-start="1051.20" data-end="1057.88">「你沒事吧，小袋子親愛的？」袋鼠焦急地問道。「沒事！」小袋子說。「看我游--」</p>
    <p data-start="1059.22" data-end="1067.84">and down he went over the next waterfall into another pool. Everybody was doing something to help.</p>
    <p data-start="1059.22" data-end="1067.84">然後他又從另一個瀑布跌入了另一個水池。每個人都在努力幫忙。</p>
    <p data-start="1068.92" data-end="1095.58">Piglet, wide awake suddenly, was jumping up and down and making "Oo, I say" noises; Owl was explaining that in a case of Sudden and Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was to keep the Head Above Water; Kanga was jumping along the bank, saying "Are you sure you're all right, Roo dear?" to which Roo, from whatever pool he was in at the moment, was answering "Look at me swimming!"</p>
    <p data-start="1068.92" data-end="1095.58">小豬突然清醒過來，跳上跳下，發出「哦，我說」的聲音；貓頭鷹解釋說，在突然和暫時的浸泡情況下，重要的是要保持頭部在水面上；袋鼠沿著岸邊跳著說「你確定你沒事吧，小袋子親愛的？」而無論小袋子此時在哪個水池，他都會回答「看我游泳！」</p>
    <p data-start="1096.96" data-end="1107.40">Eeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which Roo fell, and with his back to the accident was grumbling quietly to himself, and saying,</p>
    <p data-start="1096.96" data-end="1107.40">驢子轉過身，把他的尾巴掛在小袋子掉進的第一個水池中，背對著事故現場，悄悄地抱怨著說，</p>
    <p data-start="1107.74" data-end="1114.56">"All this washing; but catch on to my tail, little Roo, and you'll be all right";</p>
    <p data-start="1107.74" data-end="1114.56">「所有這些洗臉的事情；但抓住我的尾巴，小袋子，你就沒事了」；</p>
    <p data-start="1116.12" data-end="1122.72">and,Christopher Robin and Rabbit came hurrying past Eeyore, and were calling out to the others in front of them.</p>
    <p data-start="1116.12" data-end="1122.72">克里斯多夫‧羅賓和兔子匆忙跑過驢子，對前面的其他人喊道。</p>
    <p data-start="1123.40" data-end="1131.94">"All right, Roo, I'm coming," called Christopher Robin. "Get something across the stream lower down, some of you fellows," called Rabbit.</p>
    <p data-start="1123.40" data-end="1131.94">「沒事的，小袋子，我來了，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓叫道。「你們有人在下游找些東西跨過溪流，」兔子喊道。</p>
    <p data-start="1132.94" data-end="1142.66">But Pooh was getting something. Two pools below Roo he was standing with a long pole in his paws, and Kanga came up and took one end of it,</p>
    <p data-start="1132.94" data-end="1142.66">但是小熊維尼正在忙著做點什麼。在小袋子的兩個水池下方，他正站著，爪子裡握著一根長杆，袋鼠走過來拿住了其中一端，</p>
    <p data-start="1143.30" data-end="1152.98">and between them they held it across the lower part of the pool; and Roo, still bubbling proudly, "Look at me swimming," drifted up against it, and climbed out.</p>
    <p data-start="1143.30" data-end="1152.98">然後他們一起把它橫在水池的下游；小袋子還自豪地冒著泡說：「看我游泳呢」，隨即被漂到杆上，爬了出來。</p>
    <p data-start="1154.30" data-end="1159.82">"Did you see me swimming?" squeaked Roo excitedly, while Kanga scolded him and rubbed him down.</p>
    <p data-start="1154.30" data-end="1159.82">「你看到我游泳了嗎？」小袋子興奮地尖叫著，而袋鼠一邊責備他，一邊幫他擦乾。</p>
    <p data-start="1160.58" data-end="1166.90">"Pooh, did you see me swimming? That's called swimming, what I was doing. Rabbit, did you see what I was doing? </p>
    <p data-start="1160.58" data-end="1166.90">「小熊維尼，你看到我游泳了嗎？我剛才做的那叫游泳。兔子，你看到我在做什麼嗎？</p>
    <p data-start="1167.44" data-end="1174.76">Swimming. Hallo, Piglet! I say, Piglet! What do you think I was doing! Swimming! Christopher Robin, did you see me--"</p>
    <p data-start="1167.44" data-end="1174.76">游泳。哈囉，小豬！我說，小豬！你覺得我在做什麼！游泳！克里斯多夫‧羅賓，你看到我--」</p>
    <p data-start="1175.70" data-end="1184.74">But Christopher Robin wasn't listening. He was looking at Pooh. "Pooh," he said, "where did you find that pole?"</p>
    <p data-start="1175.70" data-end="1184.74">但是克里斯多夫‧羅賓並沒有在聽。他正在看著小熊維尼。「小熊維尼，」他說，「你在哪裡找到這根杆的？」</p>
    <p data-start="1186.00" data-end="1187.80">Pooh looked at the pole in his hands.</p>
    <p data-start="1186.00" data-end="1187.80">小熊維尼看了看手中的杆。</p>
    <p data-start="1188.52" data-end="1208.84">"I just found it," he said. "I thought it ought to be useful. I just picked it up." "Pooh," said Christopher Robin solemnly, "the Expedition is over. You have found the North Pole!" "Oh!" said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="1188.52" data-end="1208.84">「我剛剛找到的，」他說。「我覺得它應該會有用。我就撿起來了。」 「小熊維尼，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓莊重地說，「探險結束了。你找到北極柱了！」 「哦！」小熊維尼說。</p>
    <p data-start="1210.26" data-end="1215.46">Eeyore was sitting with his tail in the water when they all got back to him.</p>
    <p data-start="1210.26" data-end="1215.46">當他們都回到驢子那裡時，驢子正坐著，尾巴泡在水裡。</p>
    <p data-start="1216.04" data-end="1225.62">"Tell Roo to be quick, somebody," he said. "My tail's getting cold. I don't want to mention it,</p>
    <p data-start="1216.04" data-end="1225.62">「叫小袋子快點，有人嗎？」他說。「我的尾巴變冷了。我不想提，</p>
    <p data-start="1225.62" data-end="1232.52">but I just mention it. I don't want to complain, but there it is. My tail's cold."</p>
    <p data-start="1225.62" data-end="1232.52">但我只是提一下。我不想抱怨，但情況就是這樣。我的尾巴冷了。」</p>
    <p data-start="1234.18" data-end="1246.14">"Here I am!" squeaked Roo. "Oh, there you are." "Did you see me swimming?" Eeyore took his tail out of the water, and swished it from side to side.</p>
    <p data-start="1234.18" data-end="1246.14">「我在這裡！」小袋子尖叫道。「哦，你在這裡。」 「你看到我游泳了嗎？」驢子把尾巴從水裡拿出來，左右甩動著。</p>
    <p data-start="1247.08" data-end="1263.44">"As I expected," he said. "Lost all feeling. Numbed it. That's what it's done. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it's all right."</p>
    <p data-start="1247.08" data-end="1263.44">「就像我預料的那樣，」他說。「失去了所有感覺。麻木了。就是這樣。麻木了。嗯，只要沒有人介意，我想應該沒事。」</p>
    <p data-start="1265.34" data-end="1272.14">"Poor old Eeyore! I'll dry it for you," said Christopher Robin, and he took out his handkerchief and rubbed it up.</p>
    <p data-start="1265.34" data-end="1272.14">「可憐的驢子！我幫你把尾巴擦乾吧，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓說，然後拿出手帕幫他擦乾。</p>
    <p data-start="1273.44" data-end="1301.76">"Thank you, Christopher Robin. You're the only one who seems to understand about tails. They don't think--that's what's the matter with some of these others. They've no imagination. A tail isn't a tail to them, it's just a Little Bit Extra at the back." "Never mind, Eeyore," said Christopher Robin, rubbing his hardest. "Is that better?"</p>
    <p data-start="1273.44" data-end="1301.76">「謝謝你，克里斯多夫‧羅賓。你是唯一一個似乎了解尾巴的人。這些其他人，他們不去思考--這就是問題所在。他們沒有想像力。對他們來說，尾巴不是尾巴，只是一點點多出來的東西。」 「別擔心，驢子，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓一邊擦著，一邊說。「這樣感覺好些了嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="1303.36" data-end="1315.72">"It's feeling more like a tail perhaps. It Belongs again, if you know what I mean." "Hullo, Eeyore," said Pooh, coming up to them with his pole.</p>
    <p data-start="1303.36" data-end="1315.72">「或許它更像尾巴了。它又回到了應有的位置，如果你知道我的意思。」 「哈囉，驢子，」小熊維尼拿著他的杆走過來說。</p>
    <p data-start="1317.34" data-end="1324.80">"Hullo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to use it again in a day or two."</p>
    <p data-start="1317.34" data-end="1324.80">「哈囉，小熊維尼。謝謝你的關心，但我應該在一兩天內能再次使用它了。」</p>
    <p data-start="1326.08" data-end="1334.80">"Use what?" said Pooh. "What we are talking about." "I wasn't talking about anything," said Pooh, looking puzzled.</p>
    <p data-start="1326.08" data-end="1334.80">「使用什麼？」小熊維尼問。「我們正在談論什麼。」 「我沒有在談論任何事情，」小熊維尼看起來困惑地說。</p>
    <p data-start="1336.08" data-end="1347.30">"My mistake again. I thought you were saying how sorry you were about my tail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?"</p>
    <p data-start="1336.08" data-end="1347.30">「又是我的錯。我以為你在說對我尾巴的麻木感到抱歉，並且問你能做些什麼來幫助我？」</p>
    <p data-start="1347.86" data-end="1376.74">"No," said Pooh. "That wasn't me," he said. He thought for a little and then suggested helpfully: "Perhaps it was somebody else." "Well, thank him for me when you see him." Pooh looked anxiously at Christopher Robin. "Pooh's found the North Pole," said Christopher Robin. "Isn't that lovely?" Pooh looked modestly down. "Is that it?" said Eeyore. 116 00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:19,280 "Yes," said Christopher Robin. "Is that what we were looking for?" "Yes," said Pooh. "Oh!" said Eeyore. "Well, anyhow--it didn't rain," he said. They stuck the pole in the ground,</p>
    <p data-start="1347.86" data-end="1376.74">「不，」小熊維尼說。「那不是我，」他說。他想了一會兒，然後幫忙建議：「或許那是別人。」 「嗯，那當你看到他時，替我感謝他。」 小熊維尼焦急地看著克里斯多夫‧羅賓。「小熊維尼找到北極柱了，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓說。「那不是很棒嗎？」 小熊維尼謙虛地低下頭。「那就是它嗎？」驢子說。「是的，」克里斯多夫‧羅賓說。「那是我們在找的東西嗎？」 「是的，」小熊維尼說。「哦！」驢子說。「嗯，無論如何--至少沒下雨，」他說。他們把杆插在地上，</p>
    <p data-start="1399.30" data-end="1411.40">and Christopher Robin tied a message on to it: NorTH PoLE DICSovERED By PooH PooH FouND IT Then they all went home again.</p>
    <p data-start="1399.30" data-end="1411.40">然後克里斯多夫‧羅賓在上面綁了一個留言：北極柱由小熊維尼發現 小熊維尼找到了它 然後他們都回家了。</p>
    <p data-start="1411.76" data-end="1419.32">And I think, but I am not quite sure, that Roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed. But Pooh went back to his own house,</p>
    <p data-start="1411.76" data-end="1419.32">我想，但不太確定，小袋子洗了個熱水澡，然後直接上床睡覺了。但是小熊維尼回到了自己的家，</p>
    <p data-start="1419.92" data-end="1424.84">and feeling very proud of what he had done, had a little something to revive himself.</p>
    <p data-start="1419.92" data-end="1424.84">感覺對自己所做的事情非常自豪，然後吃了一點點東西來恢復元氣。</p>
