    <p data-start="18.00" data-end="20.92" style="margin-left: 35%;">INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p data-start="18.00" data-end="20.92" style="margin-left: 35%;">介紹</p>
    <p data-start="22.44" data-end="36.74">To her Hand in hand we come Christopher Robin and I To lay this book in your lap. Say you're surprised? Say it's just what you wanted? Because it's yours - because we love you.</p>
    <p data-start="22.44" data-end="36.74">我們手牽著手，克里斯多夫·羅賓和我，來到這裡，將這本書放在妳的膝上。妳說妳很驚訝？妳說這正是妳想要的？因為這是妳的——因為我們愛妳。</p>
    <p data-start="37.56" data-end="54.98">IF you happen to have read another book about Christopher Robin, you may remember that he once had a swan (or the swan had Christopher Robin, I don't know which) and that he used to call this swan Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="37.56" data-end="54.98">如果你碰巧讀過另外一本關於克里斯多夫·羅賓的書，你可能記得他曾經有一隻天鵝（或者說那隻天鵝有克里斯多夫·羅賓，我不太確定是哪一個），而且他習慣叫這隻天鵝普。</p>
    <p data-start="55.06" data-end="82.90">That was a long time ago, and when we said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we didn't think the swan would want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear said that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once, without stopping to think, that he was Winnie-the-Pooh. And he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh part, I will now explain the rest of it.</p>
    <p data-start="55.06" data-end="82.90">那已經是很久以前的事了，當我們說再見時，我們把這個名字帶走了，因為我們不認為天鵝還會需要它。後來，當愛德華熊說他想要一個屬於自己的令人興奮的名字時，克里斯多夫·羅賓立刻說，不假思索地說，他是小熊維尼。沒錯，他就是小熊維尼。所以，既然我已經解釋了“維尼”這部分，現在我來解釋剩下的部分。</p>
    <p data-start="83.94" data-end="112.90">You can't be in London for long without going to the Zoo. There are some people who begin the Zoo at the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called WAYOUT, but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the most, and stay there. So when Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes to where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something to the third keeper from the left,</p>
    <p data-start="83.94" data-end="112.90">在倫敦，你不可能待很久而不去動物園。有些人會從動物園的入口開始，這裡叫“WAYIN”，他們快速地走過每個籠子，直到他們到達出口叫“WAYOUT”的地方，但最好的人會直接去他們最喜歡的動物那裡，並且待在那裡。所以，當克里斯多夫·羅賓去動物園時，他會走到北極熊所在的地方，並對從左數第三個管理員耳語一些話，</p>
    <p data-start="113.60" data-end="141.90">and doors are unlocked, and we wander through dark passages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage, and the cage is opened, and out trots something brown and furry, and with a happy cry of "Oh, Bear!" Christopher Robin rushes into its arms. Now this bear's name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears it is, but the funny thing is that we can't remember whether Winnie is called after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie.</p>
    <p data-start="113.60" data-end="141.90">接著門被打開，我們穿過黑暗的通道，爬上陡峭的樓梯，直到我們來到一個特別的籠子，籠子被打開，一隻棕色毛茸茸的東西快步跑出來，克里斯多夫·羅賓開心地喊著“哦，熊！”衝進它的懷裡。這隻熊的名字叫“維尼”，這證明了這是一個非常適合熊的名字，但有趣的是，我們記不清楚維尼是以普的名字命名的，還是普是以維尼的名字命名的。</p>
    <p data-start="141.92" data-end="149.78">We did know once, but we have forgotten. . . .</p>
    <p data-start="141.92" data-end="149.78">我們曾經知道，但我們已經忘記了……</p>
    <p data-start="149.78" data-end="158.02">I had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and said in his squeaky voice, "What about Me?" "My dear Piglet," I said,</p>
    <p data-start="149.78" data-end="158.02">我寫到這裡時，小豬抬起頭，用他尖細的聲音說：“那我呢？”“親愛的小豬，”我說，</p>
    <p data-start="158.78" data-end="167.18">"the whole book is about you." "So it is about Pooh," he squeaked. You see what it is.</p>
    <p data-start="158.78" data-end="167.18">“整本書都是關於你的。”“那它也是關於普的，”他尖聲說。你看是怎麼回事了吧。</p>
    <p data-start="167.20" data-end="198.76">He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is having a Grand Introduction all to himself. Pooh is the favourite, of course, there's no denying it, but Piglet comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses; because you can't take Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet is so small that he slips into a pocket, where it is very comforting to feel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or twenty-two. Sometimes he slips out and has a good look in the ink-pot,</p>
    <p data-start="167.20" data-end="198.76">他嫉妒了，因為他認為普得到了所有的介紹。普當然是最受歡迎的，這是無可否認的，但小豬也有很多普沒有的東西；因為你不能帶普去學校而不讓大家知道，但小豬太小了，他可以溜進口袋裡，當你不確定七乘二是十二還是二十二時，感覺到他在那裡非常安慰。有時候他還會溜出來，在墨水瓶裡好好看看，</p>
    <p data-start="199.52" data-end="202.80">and in this way he has got more education than Pooh,</p>
    <p data-start="199.52" data-end="202.80">因此他比普受到了更多的教育，</p>
    <p data-start="203.20" data-end="208.60">but Pooh doesn't mind. Some have brains, and some haven't, he says, and there it is.</p>
    <p data-start="203.20" data-end="208.60">但普並不介意。他說，有些人有腦子，有些人沒有，就是這樣。</p>
    <p data-start="210.34" data-end="219.24">And now all the others are saying, "What about Us?" So perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writing Introductions and get on with the book.</p>
    <p data-start="210.34" data-end="219.24">現在所有其他人都在說：“那我們呢？”所以，也許最好的辦法就是停止寫介紹，直接開始這本書。</p>
