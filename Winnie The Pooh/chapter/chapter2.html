    <p data-start="10.40" data-end="14.92">...IN WHICH POOH GOES VISITING AND GETS INTO A TIGHT PLACE</p>
    <p data-start="10.40" data-end="14.92">...在這一章中，小熊維尼去拜訪朋友，結果卡在了一個狹窄的地方</p>
    <p data-start="18.04" data-end="51.02">EDWARD BEAR, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for short, was walking through the forest one day, humming proudly to himself. He had made up a little hum that very morning, as he was doing his Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, as he stretched up as high as he could go, and then Tra-la-la, tra-la--oh, help!--la, as he tried to reach his toes.</p>
    <p data-start="18.04" data-end="51.02">有一天，愛德華熊，也就是朋友們熟知的小熊維尼，或者簡稱「維尼」，正在森林裡散步，自豪地哼著小曲。他在早晨做胖胖運動時，即在鏡子前編了這個小曲：啦啦啦，啦啦啦，他伸展到能伸到的最高處，然後啦啦啦，啦啦——哦，幫幫我！——啦，他試著碰到自己的腳趾。</p>
    <p data-start="51.02" data-end="94.24">After breakfast he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart, and now he was humming it right through, properly. It went like this: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum. Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle, Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle, Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um. Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily, wondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank was a large hole.</p>
    <p data-start="51.02" data-end="94.24">早餐後，他一遍又一遍地哼著，直到能倒背如流，現在他可以順順當當地哼完了。曲子是這樣的：啦啦啦，啦啦啦，啦啦啦，啦啦啦，隆隆隆嘚隆嘚。嘚隆嘚隆，嘚隆嘚隆，嘚隆嘚隆，嘚隆嘚隆，隆隆隆嘚隆。他這樣哼著小曲，快樂地走著，心裡想著其他人都在做什麼，做別人是什麼感覺，突然，他來到了一個沙丘前，沙丘裡有一個大洞。</p>
    <p data-start="94.50" data-end="126.86">"Aha !" said Pooh. (Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.) "If I know anything about anything, that hole means Rabbit," he said, "and Rabbit means Company," he said, "and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me-Humming and such like. Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um. So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out:</p>
    <p data-start="94.50" data-end="126.86">「啊哈！」小熊維尼說道。（隆隆隆嘚隆嘚。）「如果我對什麼有一點點瞭解的話，那個洞代表兔子，」他說，「而兔子代表客人，」他說，「而客人代表食物和聽我哼小曲之類的。隆隆隆嘚隆。」於是他彎下腰，把頭伸進洞裡，喊道：</p>
    <p data-start="127.58" data-end="151.52">"Is anybody at home?" There was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole, and then silence. "What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'" called out Pooh very loudly. "No!" said a voice; and then added, "You needn't shout so loud. I heard you quite well the first time."</p>
    <p data-start="127.58" data-end="151.52">「有沒有人在家？」洞裡傳來一陣急促的翻動聲，然後一片寂靜。「我剛才說的是，『有沒有人在家？』」小熊維尼很大聲地喊道。「沒有！」一個聲音回答，然後補充說，「你不用那麼大聲喊。我第一次就聽見了。」</p>
    <p data-start="151.96" data-end="192.16">"Bother!" said Pooh. "Isn't there anybody here at all?" "Nobody." Winnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole, and thought for a little, and he thought to himself, "There must be somebody there, because somebody must have said 'Nobody.'" So he put his head back in the hole, and said: "Hallo, Rabbit, isn't that you?" "No," said Rabbit, in a different sort of voice this time. "But isn't that Rabbit's voice?" "I don't think so,"</p>
    <p data-start="151.96" data-end="192.16">「真煩人！」小熊維尼說。「這裡真的一個人都沒有嗎？」 「沒人。」小熊維尼把頭從洞裡拿出來，思考了一會兒，他心裡想，「肯定有人在，因為一定是有人說了『沒人』。」於是他又把頭伸進洞裡，說：「哈囉，兔子，是你嗎？」 「不是，」兔子這次用一種不同的聲音回答。「但這不是兔子的聲音嗎？」 「我不這麼認為。」</p>
    <p data-start="192.84" data-end="215.96">said Rabbit. "It isn't meant to be." "Oh!" said Pooh. He took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put it back, and said: "Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?" "He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his."</p>
    <p data-start="192.84" data-end="215.96">兔子說：「不是應該這樣的。」 「哦！」小熊維尼說。他把頭從洞裡拿出來，又想了想，然後又把頭伸進去，說：「那麼，您能不能很親切地告訴我，兔子在哪裡？」 「他去看他的朋友小熊維尼了，維尼是他的一個好朋友。」</p>
    <p data-start="217.64" data-end="230.46">"But this is Me!" said Bear, very much surprised. "What sort of Me?" "Pooh Bear." "Are you sure?" said Rabbit, still more surprised.</p>
    <p data-start="217.64" data-end="230.46">「但這就是我啊！」小熊維尼非常驚訝地說。「什麼樣的我？」 「小熊維尼。」 「你確定嗎？」兔子更加驚訝地說。</p>
    <p data-start="232.24" data-end="242.94">"Quite, quite sure," said Pooh. "Oh, well, then, come in." So Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole, and at last he got in.</p>
    <p data-start="232.24" data-end="242.94">「非常、非常確定，」小熊維尼說。「哦，那麼，請進來吧。」 於是小熊維尼推啊推，擠啊擠，終於進去了。</p>
    <p data-start="244.78" data-end="273.42">"You were quite right," said Rabbit, looking at him all over. "It is you. Glad to see you." "Who did you think it was?" "Well, I wasn't sure. You know how it is in the Forest. One can't have anybody coming into one's house. One has to be careful. What about a mouthful of something?" Pooh always liked a little something at eleven o'clock in the morning, and he was very glad to see Rabbit getting out the plates and mugs;</p>
    <p data-start="244.78" data-end="273.42">「你說得對，」兔子看著他說。「的確是你。很高興見到你。」 「你以為是誰呢？」 「哦，我不確定。你知道，在森林裡，不能隨便讓任何人進來。要小心謹慎。吃點東西怎麼樣？」 小熊維尼總是喜歡在上午十一點吃點小東西，當他看到兔子拿出盤子和杯子時，他非常高興。</p>
    <p data-start="274.16" data-end="303.40">and when Rabbit said, "Honey or condensed milk with your bread?" he was so excited that he said, "Both," and then, so as not to seem greedy, he added, "But don't bother about the bread, please." And for a long time after that he said nothing . . . until at last, humming to himself in a rather sticky voice, he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and said that he must be going on.</p>
    <p data-start="274.16" data-end="303.40">當兔子問：「你的麵包是配蜂蜜還是煉乳？」 他太興奮了，說：「兩樣都要，」然後為了不顯得太貪心，他補充道，「但是別麻煩準備麵包了，拜託。」 後來，他什麼也沒說，直到最後，他用一種黏黏的聲音哼著小曲，站起來，溫柔地握著兔子的爪子，說他該走了。</p>
    <p data-start="304.36" data-end="331.68">"Must you?" said Rabbit politely "Well," said Pooh, "I could stay a little longer if it--if you----" and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder. "As a matter of fact," said Rabbit, "I was going out myself directly." "Oh well, then, I'll be going on. Good-bye."</p>
    <p data-start="304.36" data-end="331.68">「你一定要走嗎？」 兔子禮貌地說。「嗯，」小熊維尼說，「如果——如果你願意的話，我可以再待一會兒。」 於是他努力地朝食品儲藏室的方向看去。 兔子說：「事實上，我正準備出去。」 「哦，那麼，我該走了。再見。」</p>
    <p data-start="331.88" data-end="361.68">"Well, good-bye, if you're sure you won't have any more." "Is there any more?" asked Pooh quickly. Rabbit took the covers off the dishes, and said, "No, there wasn't." "I thought not," said Pooh, nodding to himself "Well, good-bye. I must be going on." So he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled with his front paws, and pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in the open again . . . </p>
    <p data-start="331.88" data-end="361.68">「那麼，再見了，如果你確定不要再吃點什麼的話。」 「還有別的東西嗎？」 小熊維尼迅速問道。兔子揭開了碟子的蓋子，說：「沒有了。」 「我就知道沒有了。」小熊維尼自言自語地點點頭說：「好吧，再見，我該走了。」於是他開始爬出洞。他用前爪拉，用後爪推，不一會兒，他的鼻子又伸到外面了......</p>
    <p data-start="361.70" data-end="377.44">and then his ears . . . and then his front paws . . . and then his shoulders . . . and then-- "Oh, help!" said Pooh. "I'd better go back." "Oh, bother!" said Pooh. "I shall have to go on." "I can't do either!" said Pooh. "Oh, help and bother!"</p>
    <p data-start="361.70" data-end="377.44">接著是他的耳朵……然後是他的前爪……接著是他的肩膀……然後——「哦，救命啊！」小熊維尼說。「我最好還是回去吧。」 「哦，真討厭！」小熊維尼說。「我必須繼續往前。」 「我哪邊也去不了！」小熊維尼說。「哦，救命啊，真討厭！」</p>
    <p data-start="391.16" data-end="420.16">Now, by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too, and finding the front door full, he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh, and looked at him. "Hallo, are you stuck?" he asked. "N-no," said Pooh carelessly. "Just resting and thinking and humming to myself." "Here, give us a paw." Pooh Bear stretched out a paw, and Rabbit pulled and pulled and pulled....</p>
    <p data-start="391.16" data-end="420.16">這時候，兔子也想去散步，發現前門被堵住了，他就從後門出去，繞到小熊維尼那邊，看看他。「哈囉，你卡住了嗎？」他問。「不，不，」小熊維尼漫不經心地說。「只是休息一下，想想事情，還有自己哼哼歌。」 「來，給我一隻爪子。」小熊維尼伸出一隻爪子，兔子拉呀拉，拉呀拉……</p>
    <p data-start="420.18" data-end="455.60">"0w!" cried Pooh. "You're hurting!" "The fact is," said Rabbit, "you're stuck." "It all comes," said Pooh crossly, "of not having front doors big enough." "It all comes," said Rabbit sternly, "of eating too much. I thought at the time," said Rabbit, "only I didn't like to say anything," said Rabbit, "that one of us has eating too much," said Rabbit, "and I knew it wasn't me," he said. "Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher Robin."</p>
    <p data-start="420.18" data-end="455.60">「啊！」小熊維尼叫道。「你弄疼我了！」 「事實上，」兔子說，「你卡住了。」 「這都是因為，」小熊維尼生氣地說，「門口不夠大。」 「這都是因為，」兔子嚴肅地說，「你吃得太多了。我那時就想到了，」兔子說，「只是我不想說，」兔子說，「我們中間有一個吃得太多了，」兔子說，「而我知道那個人不是我，」他說。「好吧，我去找克里斯多夫·羅賓來。」</p>
    <p data-start="457.62" data-end="469.42">Christopher Robin lived at the other end of the Forest, and when he came back with Rabbit, and saw the front half of Pooh, he said, "Silly old Bear," in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again.</p>
    <p data-start="457.62" data-end="469.42">克里斯多夫·羅賓住在森林的另一端，當他和兔子一起回來，看到小熊維尼的前半部分時，他說：「傻老熊，」他的聲音充滿愛意，讓大家又重新充滿了希望。</p>
    <p data-start="470.90" data-end="509.32">"I was just beginning to think," said Bear, sniffing slightly, "that Rabbit might never be able to use his front door again. And I should hate that," he said. "So should I," said Rabbit. "Use his front door again?" said Christopher Robin. "Of course he'll use his front door again. "Good," said Rabbit. "If we can't pull you out, Pooh, we might push you back." Rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully, and pointed out that, when once Pooh was pushed back, he was back, and of course nobody was more glad to see Pooh than he was,</p>
    <p data-start="470.90" data-end="509.32">「我剛剛開始想，」小熊維尼微微抽泣著說，「兔子可能再也不能用他的前門了。而我會很討厭這樣，」他說。「我也是，」兔子說。「再也不能用他的前門？」克里斯多夫·羅賓說。「當然他還能用他的前門。」「太好了，」兔子說。「如果我們不能把你拉出來，小熊維尼，我們可以把你推回去。」兔子若有所思地撓了撓鬍鬚，指出，一旦把小熊維尼推回去，他就回去了，當然，沒有人比他更高興見到小熊維尼了，</p>
    <p data-start="509.74" data-end="535.82">still there it was, some lived in trees and some lived underground, and-- "You mean I'd never get out?" said Pooh. "I mean," said Rabbit, "that having got so far, it seems a pity to waste it." Christopher Robin nodded. "Then there's only one thing to be done," he said. "We shall have to wait for you to get thin again."</p>
    <p data-start="509.74" data-end="535.82">但問題是，有些住在樹上，有些住在地下，而—— 「你的意思是我永遠出不來了？」小熊維尼說。「我的意思是，」兔子說，「既然已經走到這一步，浪費掉實在可惜。」克里斯多夫·羅賓點了點頭。「那麼只有一個辦法了，」他說。「我們必須等你變瘦。」</p>
    <p data-start="537.18" data-end="565.04">"How long does getting thin take?" asked Pooh anxiously. "About a week, I should think." "But I can't stay here for a week!" "You can stay here all right, silly old Bear. It's getting you out which is so difficult." "We'll read to you," said Rabbit cheerfully. "And I hope it won't snow," he added. "And I say, old fellow, you're taking up a good deal of room in my house</p>
    <p data-start="537.18" data-end="565.04">「變瘦要多久？」小熊維尼焦急地問。「大約一個星期，我想。」 「但我不能在這裡待一個星期！」 「你在這裡待著沒問題，傻老熊。把你弄出去才是困難的。」 「我們會讀書給你聽，」兔子愉快地說。「希望不要下雪，」他補充道。「對了，老朋友，你佔據了我家裡相當大的空間。」</p>
    <p data-start="565.56" data-end="575.50">--do you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse? Because, I mean, there they are--doing nothing--and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them."</p>
    <p data-start="565.56" data-end="575.50">——你介意我把你的後腿當作晾毛巾的架子嗎？因為，嗯，它們就那麼在那裡——沒做什麼事情——用來掛毛巾會很方便。」</p>
    <p data-start="577.50" data-end="589.92">"A week!" said Pooh gloomily. "What about meals?" "I'm afraid no meals," said Christopher Robin, "because of getting thin quicker. But we will read to you."</p>
    <p data-start="577.50" data-end="589.92">「一個星期！」小熊維尼沮喪地說。「那吃飯怎麼辦？」 「恐怕沒辦法吃飯了，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說，「這樣才能更快變瘦。不過我們會讀書給你聽。」</p>
    <p data-start="591.46" data-end="619.72">Bear began to sigh, and then found he couldn't because he was so tightly stuck; and a tear rolled down his eye, as he said: "Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?" So for a week Christopher Robin read that sort of book at the North end of Pooh, and Rabbit hung his washing on the South end . . .</p>
    <p data-start="591.46" data-end="619.72">小熊維尼開始嘆氣，但發現他因為被卡得太緊，根本嘆不了氣；一滴淚從他眼中流下，他說：「那麼，你可以讀一本撫慰人心的書，這樣能幫助和安慰一隻被牢牢卡住的熊嗎？」於是，整整一個星期，克里斯多夫·羅賓就在小熊維尼的北邊給他讀這樣的書，而兔子則把他的洗衣物晾在小熊維尼的南邊……</p>
    <p data-start="620.16" data-end="628.16">and in between Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer. And at the end of the week Christopher Robin said, "Now!"</p>
    <p data-start="620.16" data-end="628.16">而在這期間，小熊維尼感覺自己越來越瘦。到了那個星期的最後一天，克里斯多夫·羅賓說：「現在！」</p>
    <p data-start="629.26" data-end="644.38">So he took hold of Pooh's front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher Robin, and all Rabbit's friends and relations took hold of Rabbit, and they all pulled together.... And for a long time Pooh only said "Ow!" . . . And "Oh!" . . .</p>
    <p data-start="629.26" data-end="644.38">於是他抓住了小熊維尼的前爪，兔子抓住了克里斯多夫·羅賓，而兔子的所有朋友和親戚們都抓住了兔子，大家一起用力拉……而小熊維尼只說了很久的「啊！」……還有「哦！」……</p>
    <p data-start="646.94" data-end="654.12">And then, all of a sudden, he said "Pop!" just as if a cork were coming out of bottle.</p>
    <p data-start="646.94" data-end="654.12">然後，突然之間，他說了「啵！」就像是瓶塞被拔出來一樣。</p>
    <p data-start="654.12" data-end="682.72">And Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit's friends and relations went head-over-heels backwards . . . and on the top of them came Winnie-the-Pooh--free! So, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself. But, Christopher Robin looked after him lovingly, and said to himself, "Silly old Bear!"</p>
    <p data-start="654.12" data-end="682.72">接著，克里斯多夫·羅賓、兔子和兔子的所有朋友和親戚們都摔了一個跟頭……然後小熊維尼——自由了！他向朋友們點了點頭表示感謝，然後繼續驕傲地哼著小曲，走進了森林。但是，克里斯多夫·羅賓深情地看著他，對自己說：「傻老熊！」</p>
