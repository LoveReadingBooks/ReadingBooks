    <p data-start="8.66" data-end="13.26">...IN WHICH PIGLET IS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY WATER</p>
    <p data-start="8.66" data-end="13.26">……在其中小豬完全被水包圍</p>
    <p data-start="15.86" data-end="19.88">IT rained and it rained and it rained.</p>
    <p data-start="15.86" data-end="19.88">雨不停地下，越下越大。</p>
    <p data-start="21.08" data-end="27.18">Piglet told himself that never in all his life, and he was goodness knows how old--three,</p>
    <p data-start="21.08" data-end="27.18">小豬告訴自己，在他整個生命中，天知道他有多老——三歲，</p>
    <p data-start="28.20" data-end="39.12">was it, or four?--never had he seen so much rain. Days and days and days. "If only," he thought, as he looked out of the window,</p>
    <p data-start="28.20" data-end="39.12">是嗎？還是四歲？——從來沒見過這麼大的雨。連續好多天。當他望著窗外時，他想，「如果當時我在小熊維尼的家裡，或克里斯多夫·羅賓的家裡，</p>
    <p data-start="39.24" data-end="45.14">"I had been in Pooh's house, or Christopher Robin's house,</p>
    <p data-start="39.24" data-end="45.14">或兔子的家裡，當雨開始下時，那麼我這段時間就會有伴，而不是一個人孤零零的，</p>
    <p data-start="45.14" data-end="52.32">or Rabbit's house when it began to rain, then I should have had Company all this time, instead of being here all alone,</p>
    <p data-start="45.14" data-end="52.32">無事可做，只能猜測它什麼時候會停。」他想像自己和小熊維尼說話，「你見過這麼大的雨嗎，小熊？」然後小熊說，</p>
    <p data-start="52.64" data-end="63.06">with nothing to do except wonder when it will stop." And he imagined himself with Pooh, saying, "Did you ever see such rain, Pooh?" and Pooh saying,</p>
    <p data-start="52.64" data-end="63.06">「這不是很糟糕嗎，小豬？」小豬又說，「我真想知道克里斯多夫·羅賓那邊的情況怎麼樣了。」小熊說，</p>
    <p data-start="63.60" data-end="71.24">"Isn't it awful, Piglet?" and Piglet saying, "I wonder how it is over Christopher Robin's way," and Pooh saying,</p>
    <p data-start="63.60" data-end="71.24">「我想可憐的兔子這時候應該被水淹得差不多了。」這樣聊天一定很有趣，實際上，</p>
    <p data-start="72.12" data-end="81.58">"I should think poor old Rabbit is about flooded out by this time." It would have been jolly to talk like this, and really,</p>
    <p data-start="72.12" data-end="81.58">有什麼刺激的事情，比如洪水，如果你不能和別人分享，那就沒什麼意義了。因為這確實有點刺激。那些小豬經常在其中嗅來嗅去的乾涸小溝渠變成了溪流，小溪變成了河流，而他們曾經開心地在陡峭河岸之間玩耍的那條河已經從自己的河床裡流出來，到處都佔據了很多地方，</p>
    <p data-start="81.66" data-end="111.50">it wasn't much good having anything exciting like floods, if you couldn't share them with somebody. For it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches in which Piglet had nosed about so often had become streams, the little streams across which he had splashed were rivers, and the river, between whose steep banks they had played so happily, had sprawled out of its own bed and was taking up so much room everywhere,</p>
    <p data-start="81.66" data-end="111.50">小豬開始懷疑它是否很快就會流到他的床上。「這有點令人擔憂，」他對自己說，「成為一隻被水完全包圍的小動物。克里斯多夫·羅賓和小熊可以爬樹逃走，袋鼠媽媽可以跳著逃走，兔子可以挖洞逃走，貓頭鷹可以飛走，而小驢則可以……可以大聲呼救直到被救援，而我在這裡，</p>
    <p data-start="111.60" data-end="141.54">that Piglet was beginning to wonder whether it would be coming into his bed soon. "It's a little Anxious," he said to himself, "to be a Very Small Animal Entirely Surrounded by Water. Christopher Robin and Pooh could escape by Climbing Trees, and Kanga could escape by Jumping, and Rabbit could escape by Burrowing, and Owl could escape by Flying, and Eeyore could escape by--by Making a Loud Noise Until Rescued, and here am I,</p>
    <p data-start="111.60" data-end="141.54">被水包圍著，我什麼都做不了。」雨一直下著，每一天水位都升高一點，</p>
    <p data-start="141.60" data-end="151.30">surrounded by water and I can't do anything." It went on raining, and every day the water got a little higher,</p>
    <p data-start="141.60" data-end="151.30">直到現在水幾乎快要淹到小豬的窗戶了……但他還是什麼也沒做。</p>
    <p data-start="151.30" data-end="159.14">until now it was nearly up to Piglet's window . . . and still he hadn't done anything.</p>
    <p data-start="151.30" data-end="159.14">「還有小熊，」他自言自語道。「小熊沒什麼腦子，但他從來沒有遇到什麼危險。他做些傻事，但總是有好的結果。還有貓頭鷹。貓頭鷹也不是很有腦子，但他懂得很多事。</p>
    <p data-start="161.20" data-end="175.70">"There's Pooh," he thought to himself. "Pooh hasn't much Brain, but he never comes to any harm. He does silly things and they turn out right. There's Owl. Owl hasn't exactly got Brain, but he Knows Things.</p>
    <p data-start="161.20" data-end="175.70">他會知道在被水包圍時應該做什麼。還有兔子。他沒從書本裡學過，但他總能想出聰明的計劃。還有袋鼠媽媽。她不算聰明，袋鼠媽媽不聰明，</p>
    <p data-start="176.48" data-end="182.52">He would know the Right Thing to Do when Surrounded by Water. There's Rabbit. He hasn't Learnt in Books,</p>
    <p data-start="176.48" data-end="182.52">當他被水包圍時，他就會知道該做什麼正確的事。有兔子。他雖然沒有從書本中學到，</p>
    <p data-start="182.58" data-end="191.44">but he can always Think of a Clever Plan. There's Kanga. She isn't Clever, Kanga isn't,</p>
    <p data-start="182.58" data-end="191.44">但他總是能想出一個巧妙的計劃。還有袋鼠媽媽。她不聰明，袋鼠媽媽不聰明，</p>
    <p data-start="191.44" data-end="196.88">but she would be so anxious about Roo that she would do a Good Thing to Do without thinking about it.</p>
    <p data-start="191.44" data-end="196.88">但她會因為太擔心小小袋而在不假思索中做出應該做的好事。</p>
    <p data-start="196.90" data-end="206.32">And then there's Eeyore And Eeyore is so miserable anyhow that he wouldn't mind about this.</p>
    <p data-start="196.90" data-end="206.32">然後還有小驢，小驢反正一直都很憂鬱，所以他根本不在乎這些。</p>
    <p data-start="206.32" data-end="220.04">But I wonder what Christopher Robin would do?" Then suddenly he remembered a story which Christopher Robin had told him about a man on a desert island who had written something in a bottle and thrown it in the sea;</p>
    <p data-start="206.32" data-end="220.04">但我想知道克里斯多夫·羅賓會怎麼做？」然後他突然想起克里斯多夫·羅賓曾經給他講過一個故事，關於一個人在荒島上寫了些東西放進瓶子裡，然後把瓶子扔進海裡；</p>
    <p data-start="220.42" data-end="224.68">and Piglet thought that if he wrote something in a bottle and threw it in the water,</p>
    <p data-start="220.42" data-end="224.68">於是小豬想，如果他把一些話寫在瓶子裡，然後扔進水裡，</p>
    <p data-start="225.36" data-end="241.66">perhaps somebody would come and rescue him! He left the window and began to search his house, all of it that wasn't under water, and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry paper, and a bottle with a cork to it. And he wrote on one side of the paper:</p>
    <p data-start="225.36" data-end="241.66">也許有人會來救他！他離開窗戶，開始在家裡搜尋所有沒有被水淹沒的地方，最後他找到了一支鉛筆、一小片乾紙和一個帶塞子的瓶子。他在紙的一面寫道：</p>
    <p data-start="243.04" data-end="249.36">HELP! PIGLIT (ME) and on the other side: IT'S ME PIGLIT, HELP HELP!</p>
    <p data-start="243.04" data-end="249.36">救命！小豬（是我）</p> 
    <p data-start="250.34" data-end="279.28">Then he put the paper in the bottle, and he corked the bottle up as tightly as he could, and he leant out of his window as far as he could lean without falling in, and he threw the bottle as far as he could throw --splash!--and in a little while it bobbed up again on the water; and he watched it floating slowly away in the distance, until his eyes ached with looking, and sometimes he thought it was the bottle, and sometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water which he was following,</p>
    <p data-start="250.34" data-end="279.28">在另一面寫道：是我，小豬，救命，救命！然後他把紙放進瓶子裡，盡可能緊緊地塞好瓶塞，他儘可能地從窗戶探出身子，盡可能遠地把瓶子扔出去——撲通一聲！——過了一會兒，瓶子又浮上了水面；他看著它慢慢地飄遠，直到他看得眼睛發痛，有時他以為那是瓶子，有時他以為只是他在追隨水面上的一個漣漪，</p>
    <p data-start="279.66" data-end="288.00">and then suddenly he knew that he would never see it again and that he had done all that he could do to save himself.</p>
    <p data-start="279.66" data-end="288.00">然後他突然明白他再也不會看到它了，而他已經盡了全力來拯救自己。</p>
    <p data-start="289.88" data-end="302.28">"So now," he thought, "somebody else will have to do something, and I hope they will do it soon, because if they don't I shall have to swim, which I can't, so I hope they do it soon."</p>
    <p data-start="289.88" data-end="302.28">「所以現在，」他想，「別人必須做點什麼了，我希望他們很快就能這麼做，因為如果他們不這麼做，我就得游泳了，但我不會游泳，所以我希望他們快點行動。」</p>
    <p data-start="303.44" data-end="338.90">And then he gave a very long sigh and said, "I wish Pooh were here. It's so much more friendly with two." When the rain began Pooh was asleep. It rained, and it rained, and it rained, and he slept and he slept and he slept. He had had a tiring day. You remember how he discovered the North Pole; well, he was so proud of this that he asked Christopher Robin if there were any other Poles such as a Bear of Little Brain might discover. "There's a South Pole,"</p>
    <p data-start="303.44" data-end="338.90">然後他長長地嘆了一口氣，說：「我真希望小熊在這裡。有兩個人一起，感覺會友好得多。」當雨開始下時，小熊正在睡覺。雨一直下，他一直睡。他那天過得很累。你還記得他怎麼發現北極的吧；嗯，他為此感到非常自豪，於是他問克里斯多夫·羅賓是否還有其他類似的極地讓一個沒什麼腦子的熊來發現。「還有南極，」</p>
    <p data-start="339.42" data-end="345.88">said Christopher Robin, "and I expect there's an East Pole and a West Pole, though people don't like talking about them."</p>
    <p data-start="339.42" data-end="345.88">克里斯多夫·羅賓說，「我想還有東極和西極，儘管人們不太喜歡談論它們。」</p>
    <p data-start="346.14" data-end="359.00">Pooh was very excited when he heard this, and suggested that they should have an Expotition to discover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had thought of something else to do with Kanga;</p>
    <p data-start="346.14" data-end="359.00">當小熊聽到這些時，他非常興奮，建議他們應該組織一次探險去發現東極，但克里斯多夫·羅賓想到和袋鼠媽媽一起做別的事情；</p>
    <p data-start="359.34" data-end="368.84">so Pooh went out to discover the East Pole by himself. Whether he discovered it or not, I forget;</p>
    <p data-start="359.34" data-end="368.84">所以小熊自己出去發現東極。至於他是否真的發現了，我已經忘了；</p>
    <p data-start="369.02" data-end="374.34">but he was so tired when he got home that, in the very middle of his supper, after he had been eating for little more than half-an-hour,</p>
    <p data-start="369.02" data-end="374.34">但他回家時非常累，以至於在吃晚餐的中途，在吃了還不到半小時後，</p>
    <p data-start="374.48" data-end="384.04">he fell fast asleep in his chair, and slept and slept and slept. Then suddenly he was dreaming.</p>
    <p data-start="374.48" data-end="384.04">他就在椅子上睡著了，並且睡了很久。然後他突然做起了夢。</p>
    <p data-start="384.06" data-end="414.00">He was at the East Pole, and it was a very cold pole with the coldest sort of snow and ice all over it. He had found a bee-hive to sleep in, but there wasn't room for his legs, so he had left them outside. And Wild Woozles, such as inhabit the East Pole, came and nibbled all the fur off his legs to make Nests for their Young. And the more they nibbled, the colder his legs got, until suddenly he woke up with an Ow!</p>
    <p data-start="384.06" data-end="414.00">他夢見自己在東極，那是一個非常寒冷的極地，到處覆蓋著最冷的雪和冰。他找到了一個蜂巢可以睡覺，但沒有地方放他的腿，所以他把腿留在了外面。住在東極的野生猩猩來了，把他腿上的毛都咬掉了，用來為牠們的小寶寶築巢。牠們越咬，他的腿就越冷，直到突然間他大叫一聲醒了過來！</p>
    <p data-start="415.84" data-end="427.38">--and there he was, sitting in his chair with his feet in the water, and water all round him! He splashed to his door and looked out....</p>
    <p data-start="415.84" data-end="427.38">——他就這樣坐在椅子上，腳泡在水裡，周圍都是水！他撲通一聲跑到門口往外看……</p>
    <p data-start="428.66" data-end="433.16">"This is Serious," said Pooh. "I must have an Escape."</p>
    <p data-start="428.66" data-end="433.16">「這是很嚴重的，」小熊說。「我必須逃生。」</p>
    <p data-start="434.42" data-end="440.48">So he took his largest pot of honey and escaped with it to a broad branch of his tree, well above the water,</p>
    <p data-start="434.42" data-end="440.48">於是他拿起他最大的一罐蜂蜜，帶著它逃到了他樹上的一根寬闊樹枝上，遠離水面，</p>
    <p data-start="442.06" data-end="470.70">and then he climbed down again and escaped with another pot . . . and when the whole Escape was finished, there was Pooh sitting on his branch dangling his legs,</p>
    <p data-start="442.06" data-end="470.70">然後他又爬下來，帶著另一罐蜂蜜逃走……當他完成了整個逃生過程時，小熊已經坐在樹枝上，雙腿垂下，</p>
    <p data-start="471.36" data-end="487.00">and there, beside him, were ten pots of honey.... Two days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and there, beside him, were four pots of honey.... Three days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and there beside him, was one pot of honey. Four days later, there was Pooh . . . And it was on the morning of the fourth day that Piglet's bottle came floating past him,</p>
    <p data-start="471.36" data-end="487.00">在他旁邊，有十罐蜂蜜……兩天後，小熊坐在他的樹枝上，晃著雙腿，在他旁邊，有四罐蜂蜜……三天後，小熊坐在他的樹枝上，晃著雙腿，在他旁邊，只有一罐蜂蜜。四天後，小熊……就在第四天的早晨，小豬的瓶子漂過了他身邊，</p>
    <p data-start="487.56" data-end="494.12">and with one loud cry of "Honey!" Pooh plunged into the water, seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree again.</p>
    <p data-start="487.56" data-end="494.12">小熊大喊一聲「蜂蜜！」便跳進水裡，抓住瓶子，艱難地返回他的樹上。</p>
    <p data-start="496.02" data-end="503.26">"Bother!" said Pooh, as he opened it. "All that wet for nothing. What's that bit of paper doing?"</p>
    <p data-start="496.02" data-end="503.26">「煩人！」小熊打開瓶子時說，「這麼多水都白費了。這張紙是幹嘛的？」</p>
    <p data-start="504.44" data-end="514.80">He took it out and looked at it. "It's a Missage," he said to himself, "that's what it is. And that letter is a 'P,'</p>
    <p data-start="504.44" data-end="514.80">他拿出紙條，看了看。「這是一條訊息，」他對自己說，「這就是它的用途。而且這個字母是‘P’，</p>
    <p data-start="515.66" data-end="529.42">and so is that, and so is that, and 'P' means 'Pooh,' so it's a very important Message to me, and I can't read it.</p>
    <p data-start="515.66" data-end="529.42">這個也是，那個也是，而‘P’代表‘Pooh’，所以這是一條對我來說非常重要的訊息，但我看不懂。」</p>
    <p data-start="529.82" data-end="546.28">I must find Christopher Robin or Owl or Piglet, one of those Clever Readers who can read things, and they will tell me what this missage means. Only I can't swim. Bother!"</p>
    <p data-start="529.82" data-end="546.28">「我必須找到克里斯多夫·羅賓，或者貓頭鷹，或者小豬，他們都是那些聰明的讀書人，能夠讀懂這些東西，他們會告訴我這條訊息是什麼意思。只是我不會游泳。真煩人！」</p>
    <p data-start="547.84" data-end="555.76">Then he had an idea, and I think that for a Bear of Very Little Brain, it was a good idea. He said to himself:</p>
    <p data-start="547.84" data-end="555.76">然後他想到了一個主意，我覺得對於一隻頭腦簡單的熊來說，這是一個好主意。他對自己說：</p>
    <p data-start="557.82" data-end="587.76">"If a bottle can float, then a jar can float, and if a jar floats, I can sit on the top of it, if it's a very big jar." So he took his biggest jar, and corked it up. "All boats have to have a name," he said, "so I shall call mine The Floating Bear." And with these words he dropped his boat into the water and jumped in after it.</p>
    <p data-start="557.82" data-end="587.76">「如果瓶子可以浮，那麼罐子也可以浮，如果罐子浮起來，我可以坐在它上面，只要它是一個非常大的罐子。」於是他拿出他最大的罐子，並緊緊塞好瓶塞。「所有的船都得有個名字，」他說，「所以我應該把我的船叫做‘漂浮的小熊’。」說完，他把他的船丟進水裡，然後跳了進去。</p>
    <p data-start="587.82" data-end="617.64">For a little while Pooh and The Floating Bear were uncertain as to which of them was meant to be on the top, but after trying one or two different positions, they settled down with The Floating Bear underneath and Pooh triumphantly astride it, paddling vigorously with his feet. Christopher Robin lived at the very top of the Forest. It rained, and it rained, and it rained, but the water couldn't come up to his house.</p>
    <p data-start="587.82" data-end="617.64">有一會兒，小熊和「漂浮的小熊」都不確定誰應該在上面，但在嘗試了幾個不同的姿勢後，他們終於安定下來，小熊坐在「漂浮的小熊」上，得意洋洋地跨在上面，用雙腳拼命划水。克里斯多夫·羅賓住在森林的最頂端。雨一直下，但水卻沒法上到他的房子那裡。</p>
    <p data-start="618.56" data-end="647.70">It was rather jolly to look down into the valleys and see the water all round him, but it rained so hard that he stayed indoors most of the time, and thought about things. Every morning he went out with his umbrella and put a stick in the place where the water came up to, and every next morning he went out and couldn't see his stick any more, so he put another stick in the place where the water came up to, and then he walked home again,</p>
    <p data-start="618.56" data-end="647.70">看著四周的山谷都被水包圍著，感覺還挺愉快的，但雨下得太大了，所以他大部分時間都待在屋裡，思考著各種事情。他每天早上都會帶著雨傘出去，並在水位升到的地方插上一根樹枝，第二天早上他出去時，已經看不到那根樹枝了，所以他在水位升到的地方又插上另一根樹枝，然後再走回家。</p>
    <p data-start="647.82" data-end="661.98">and each morning he had a shorter way to walk than he had had the morning before. On the morning of the fifth day he saw the water all round him, and he new that for the first time in his life he was on a real island. Which is very exciting.</p>
    <p data-start="647.82" data-end="661.98">每天早上，他走的路比前一天早上要短一點。到了第五天早上，他看到四周都是水，第一次意識到他真正地在一個島上。這是非常令人興奮的。</p>
    <p data-start="663.90" data-end="669.54">It was on this morning that Owl came flying over the water to say "How do you do?" to his friend Christopher Robin.</p>
    <p data-start="663.90" data-end="669.54">就在這天早上，貓頭鷹飛過水面，來向他的朋友克里斯多夫·羅賓問好。</p>
    <p data-start="671.30" data-end="682.00">"I say, Owl," said Christopher Robin, "isn't this fun? I'm on an island!" "The atmospheric conditions have been very unfavourable lately," said Owl.</p>
    <p data-start="671.30" data-end="682.00">「嘿，貓頭鷹，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說，「這是不是很有趣？我在一個島上！」貓頭鷹說：「最近大氣條件非常不利。」</p>
    <p data-start="682.54" data-end="697.12">"The what?" "It has been raining," explained Owl. "Yes," said Christopher Robin. "It has." "The flood-level has reached an unprecedented height." "The who?"</p>
    <p data-start="682.54" data-end="697.12">「什麼？」克里斯多夫·羅賓問。「一直在下雨，」貓頭鷹解釋道。「是的，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說，「是的。」貓頭鷹說：「洪水水位達到了前所未有的高度。」克里斯多夫·羅賓問：「誰？」</p>
    <p data-start="698.24" data-end="727.32">"There's a lot of water about," explained Owl. "Yes," said Christopher Robin, "there is." "However, the prospects are rapidly becoming more favourable. At any moment--" "Have you seen Pooh?" "No. At any moment--" "I hope he's all right," said Christopher Robin. "I've been wondering about him. I expect Piglet's with him. Do you think they're all right, Owl?" "I expect so. You see, at any moment--"</p>
    <p data-start="698.24" data-end="727.32">「水很多，」貓頭鷹解釋道。「是的，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說，「是的。」貓頭鷹說：「不過，情況很快就會變得更好。隨時可能——」克里斯多夫·羅賓打斷了他：「你有看到小熊嗎？」貓頭鷹說：「沒有。隨時可能——」克里斯多夫·羅賓說：「我希望他沒事，我一直在想他。我猜小豬跟他在一起。你覺得他們沒事吧，貓頭鷹？」貓頭鷹說：「我猜應該沒事。你看，隨時可能——」</p>
    <p data-start="727.34" data-end="734.46">"Do go and see, Owl. Because Pooh hasn't got very much brain, and he might do something silly, and I do love him so, Owl. Do you see, Owl?"</p>
    <p data-start="727.34" data-end="734.46">「貓頭鷹，你快去看看吧。因為小熊腦子不太靈光，他可能會做些蠢事，而我非常愛他，貓頭鷹。你懂嗎，貓頭鷹？」</p>
    <p data-start="734.46" data-end="744.88">"That's all right," said Owl. "I'll go. Back directly." And he flew off. In a little while he was back again.</p>
    <p data-start="734.46" data-end="744.88">「沒問題，」貓頭鷹說。「我去看看。馬上回來。」然後他飛走了。不久之後，他又回來了。</p>
    <p data-start="745.86" data-end="760.92">Pooh isn't there," he said. "Not there?" "He's been there. He's been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his house with nine pots of honey. But he isn't there now."</p>
    <p data-start="745.86" data-end="760.92">「小熊不在那裡，」他說。「不在那裡？」克里斯多夫·羅賓問。「他在那裡待過。他一直坐在他樹外的樹枝上，旁邊有九罐蜂蜜。但他現在不在那裡了。」</p>
    <p data-start="761.78" data-end="791.24">"Oh, Pooh!" cried Christopher Robin. "Where are you?" "Here I am," said a growly voice behind him. "Pooh!" They rushed into each other's arms. "How did you get here, Pooh?" asked Christopher Robin, when he was ready to talk again. "On my boat," said Pooh proudly. "I had a Very Important Missage sent me in a bottle, and owing to having got some water in my eyes, I couldn't read it,</p>
    <p data-start="761.78" data-end="791.24">「哦，小熊！」克里斯多夫·羅賓喊道。「你在哪裡？」「我在這裡，」一個低沉的聲音在他背後說。「小熊！」他們衝進對方的懷抱。「你是怎麼來這裡的，小熊？」克里斯多夫·羅賓再次能說話時問道。「我坐我的船來的，」小熊自豪地說。「我收到了一條非常重要的訊息，是放在瓶子裡送來的，因為眼睛進了水，我看不懂，」</p>
    <p data-start="791.32" data-end="800.50">so I brought it to you. On my boat." With these proud words he gave Christopher Robin the missage.</p>
    <p data-start="791.32" data-end="800.50">所以我把它帶給你了，用我的船。」他滿懷自豪地把訊息交給克里斯多夫·羅賓。</p>
    <p data-start="802.24" data-end="809.64">"But it's from Piglet!" cried Christopher Robin when he had read it. "Isn't there anything about Pooh in it?"</p>
    <p data-start="802.24" data-end="809.64">「但是這是小豬送的！」克里斯多夫·羅賓讀完後喊道。「裡面有沒有提到小熊？」</p>
    <p data-start="810.10" data-end="818.24">asked Bear, looking over his shoulder. Christopher Robin read the message aloud. "Oh, are those 'P's' piglets?</p>
    <p data-start="810.10" data-end="818.24">小熊問道，瞧著他的肩膀。克里斯多夫·羅賓大聲讀出訊息。「哦，這些‘P’是指小豬？</p>
    <p data-start="819.24" data-end="848.20">I thought they were poohs." "We must rescue him at once! I thought he was with you, Pooh. Owl, could you rescue him on your back?" "I don't think so," said Owl, after grave thought. "It is doubtful if the necessary dorsal muscles " "Then would you fly to him at once and say that Rescue is Coming? And Pooh and I will think of a Rescue and come as quick as ever we can. Oh, don't talk, Owl, goon quick!"</p>
    <p data-start="819.24" data-end="848.20">我以為是小熊。」克里斯多夫·羅賓說。「我們必須立刻去救他！我還以為他跟你在一起呢，小熊。貓頭鷹，你能載著他救他嗎？」「我想不行，」貓頭鷹經過深思熟慮後說。「我懷疑是否有足夠的背部肌肉……」「那你能立刻飛去告訴他救援即將到來嗎？小熊和我會想辦法救他，並且盡快趕到。哦，別說話了，貓頭鷹，趕快去吧！」</p>
    <p data-start="848.42" data-end="859.62">And, still thinking of something to say, Owl flew off. "Now then, Pooh," said Christopher Robin, "where's your boat?"</p>
    <p data-start="848.42" data-end="859.62">貓頭鷹還在想著要說什麼，就飛走了。「現在，小熊，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說，「你的船在哪裡？」</p>
    <p data-start="859.62" data-end="874.60">"I ought to say," explained Pooh as they walked down to the shore of the island, "that it isn't just an ordinary sort of boat. Sometimes it's a Boat, and sometimes it's more of an Accident. It all depends."</p>
    <p data-start="859.62" data-end="874.60">「我應該說明一下，」當他們走到島的岸邊時，小熊解釋說，「這不僅僅是一艘普通的船。有時它是船，有時它更像是一場意外。這全看情況。」</p>
    <p data-start="876.06" data-end="904.96">"Depends on what?" "On whether I'm on top of it or underneath it." "Oh! Well, where is it?" "There!" said Pooh, pointing proudly to The Floating Bear. It wasn't what Christopher Robin expected, and the more he looked at it, the more he thought what a Brave and Clever Bear Pooh was, and the more Christopher Robin thought this, the more Pooh looked modestly down his nose and tried to pretend he wasn't.</p>
    <p data-start="876.06" data-end="904.96">「看什麼情況？」克里斯多夫·羅賓問。「看我是坐在上面還是在下面。」小熊說。「哦！那它在哪裡？」「在那裡！」小熊驕傲地指向「漂浮的小熊」。這不是克里斯多夫·羅賓預期中的樣子，他看得越久，就越覺得小熊是一隻多麼勇敢而聰明的熊，而克里斯多夫·羅賓越這樣想，小熊就越謙虛地低下鼻子，假裝不是自己做的。</p>
    <p data-start="905.06" data-end="934.94">"But it's too small for two of us," said Christopher Robin sadly. "Three of us with Piglet." "That makes it smaller still Oh, Pooh Bear, what shall we do?" And then this Bear, Pooh Bear, Winnie-the-Pooh, F.O.P. (Friend of Piglet's), R.C. (Rabbit's Companion), P.D. (Pole Discoverer),</p>
    <p data-start="905.06" data-end="934.94">「但是這艘船對我們兩個來說太小了，」克里斯多夫·羅賓難過地說。「如果加上小豬，我們三個人，那就更小了。哦，小熊，我們該怎麼辦？」然後這隻熊，小熊，維尼熊，P.O.P.（小豬的朋友），R.C.（兔子的夥伴），P.D.（極地探險家），</p>
    <p data-start="934.98" data-end="948.64">E.C. and T.F. (Eeyore's Comforter and Tail-finder)--in fact, Pooh himself--said something so clever that Christopher Robin could only look at him with mouth open and eyes staring,</p>
    <p data-start="934.98" data-end="948.64">E.C.和T.F.（屹耳的安慰者和尾巴尋找者）——其實，就是小熊自己——說了一句如此聰明的話，以至於克里斯多夫·羅賓只能張大嘴巴，睜大眼睛看著他，</p>
    <p data-start="949.68" data-end="955.72">wondering if this was really the Bear of Very Little Brain whom he had know and loved so long.</p>
    <p data-start="949.68" data-end="955.72">懷疑這是否真的是那隻他所熟悉並愛了這麼久的「頭腦簡單的小熊」。</p>
    <p data-start="956.74" data-end="971.12">"We might go in your umbrella," said Pooh. "?" "We might go in your umbrella," said Pooh? "??" "We might go in your umbrella," said Pooh. "!!!!!!"</p>
    <p data-start="956.74" data-end="971.12">「我們可以坐在你的雨傘裡去，」小熊說。「？」克里斯多夫·羅賓問。「我們可以坐在你的雨傘裡去，」小熊說。「？？」克里斯多夫·羅賓再問。「我們可以坐在你的雨傘裡去，」小熊說。「！！！！」</p>
    <p data-start="972.52" data-end="981.44">For suddenly Christopher Robin saw that they might. He opened his umbrella and put it point downwards in the water.</p>
    <p data-start="972.52" data-end="981.44">突然之間，克里斯多夫·羅賓意識到他們確實可以這麼做。他打開雨傘，把傘尖朝下放進水裡。</p>
    <p data-start="981.58" data-end="1011.20">It floated but wobbled. Pooh got in. He was just beginning to say that it was all right now, when he found that it wasn't, so after a short drink, which he didn't really want, he waded back to Christopher Robin. Then they both got in together, and it wobbled no longer. "I shall call this boat The Brain of Pooh," said Christopher Robin, and The Brain of Pooh set sail forthwith in a south-westerly direction, revolving gracefully.</p>
    <p data-start="981.58" data-end="1011.20">它浮了起來，但有些搖晃。小熊進去了。他剛想說現在沒問題了，卻發現實際上還是有問題的，所以在他不太想喝的短暫喝水後，他又回到了克里斯多夫·羅賓身邊。然後他們兩個一起進去，雨傘就不再搖晃了。「我會把這艘船叫做‘小熊的頭腦’，」克里斯多夫·羅賓說，然後「小熊的頭腦」馬上啟航，朝西南方向優雅地旋轉。</p>
    <p data-start="1011.42" data-end="1027.54">You can imagine Piglet's joy when at last the ship came in sight of him. In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood,</p>
    <p data-start="1011.42" data-end="1027.54">你可以想像小豬看到船時的喜悅。多年後，他喜歡認為自己在可怕的洪水中處於非常大的危險中，</p>
    <p data-start="1027.54" data-end="1033.60">but the only danger he had really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment,</p>
    <p data-start="1027.54" data-end="1033.60">但事實上他真正遇到的唯一危險是在他被困的最後半小時，</p>
    <p data-start="1034.32" data-end="1039.84">when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him,</p>
    <p data-start="1034.32" data-end="1039.84">當時剛飛來的貓頭鷹坐在他樹上的一根樹枝上安慰他，</p>
    <p data-start="1039.86" data-end="1046.90">and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on,</p>
    <p data-start="1039.86" data-end="1046.90">並告訴了他一個關於他姑媽的很長的故事，她曾經錯誤地下了一顆海鷗蛋，故事沒完沒了，</p>
    <p data-start="1046.90" data-end="1052.42">rather like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope,</p>
    <p data-start="1046.90" data-end="1052.42">就像這個句子一樣，直到小豬在窗口聽著已經不抱什麼希望了，</p>
    <p data-start="1052.48" data-end="1066.36">went to sleep quietly and naturally, slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden loud squawk from Owl,</p>
    <p data-start="1052.48" data-end="1066.36">他安靜自然地睡著了，慢慢地從窗口滑向水面，直到他只靠腳趾頭掛著，就在這一刻，幸運的是，貓頭鷹突然發出一聲響亮的尖叫，</p>
    <p data-start="1066.38" data-end="1095.82">which was really part of the story, being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, "How interesting, and did she?" when--well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; Ist Mate, P. Bear) coming over the sea to rescue him.. ..</p>
    <p data-start="1066.38" data-end="1095.82">這實際上是故事的一部分，正是他姑媽說的那句話，把小豬驚醒了，剛好讓他有時間猛地拉回自己，回到安全的地方，然後說：「真有趣，她真的這麼做了嗎？」當時——你可以想像他看到那艘好船，「小熊的頭腦」（船長：克里斯多夫·羅賓；一等助手：小熊）正從海上來救他時的喜悅……</p>
    <p data-start="1096.06" data-end="1105.20">And as that is really the end of the story, and I am very tired after that last sentence, I think I shall stop there.</p>
    <p data-start="1096.06" data-end="1105.20">既然這真的是故事的結尾了，而我在那最後一句話後非常累了，我想我就停在這裡吧。</p>
