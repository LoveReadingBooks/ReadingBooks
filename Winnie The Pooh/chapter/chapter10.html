    <p data-start="7.40" data-end="13.26">...IN WHICH CHRISTOPHER ROBIN GIVES A POOH PARTY, AND WE SAY GOOD-BYE</p>
    <p data-start="7.40" data-end="13.26">...在這一章中，克里斯多福·羅賓為小熊維尼舉辦了一個派對，我們也要說再見了</p>
    <p data-start="15.32" data-end="20.60">ONE day when the sun had come back over the Forest, bringing with it the scent of may,</p>
    <p data-start="15.32" data-end="20.60">一天，當陽光再次照耀森林，帶來了五月的氣息，</p>
    <p data-start="21.02" data-end="26.78">and all the streams of the Forest were tinkling happily to find themselves their own pretty shape again,</p>
    <p data-start="21.02" data-end="26.78">森林中的小溪們愉快地叮噹作響，發現自己又恢復了美麗的模樣，</p>
    <p data-start="27.30" data-end="48.74">and the little pools lay dreaming of the life they had seen and the big things they had done, and in the warmth and quiet of the Forest the cuckoo was trying over his voice carefully and listening to see if he liked it, and wood-pigeons were complaining gently to themselves in their lazy comfortable way that it was the other fellow's fault, but it didn't matter very much;</p>
    <p data-start="27.30" data-end="48.74">小池塘靜靜地回憶著曾經見證的生活和所做的大事，在森林的溫暖與寧靜中，布谷鳥仔細地試唱著自己的聲音，聽聽自己喜不喜歡，而木鴿們則懶洋洋地抱怨著，說是別人的錯，但也無關緊要；</p>
    <p data-start="49.76" data-end="58.32">on such a day as this Christopher Robin whistled in a special way he had, and Owl came flying out of the Hundred Acre Wood to see what was wanted.</p>
    <p data-start="49.76" data-end="58.32">在這樣的一天，克里斯多福·羅賓用他特有的口哨聲，貓頭鷹飛出了百畝森林來看看需要什麼。</p>
    <p data-start="59.54" data-end="76.74">"Owl," said Christopher Robin, "I am going to give a party." "You are, are you?" said Owl. "And it's to be a special sort of party, because it's because of what Pooh did when he did what he did to save Piglet from the flood."</p>
    <p data-start="59.54" data-end="76.74">“貓頭鷹，”克里斯多福·羅賓說，“我打算舉辦一個派對。” “是嗎？”貓頭鷹說。 “而且這將是一個特別的派對，因為它是為了慶祝小熊維尼為了拯救小豬皮傑所做的事。”</p>
    <p data-start="77.00" data-end="87.96">"Oh, that's what it's for, is it?" said Owl. "Yes, so will you tell Pooh as quickly as you can, and all the others, because it will be to-morrow?"</p>
    <p data-start="77.00" data-end="87.96">“哦，原來是這樣啊？”貓頭鷹說。“對，所以你能否儘快告訴小熊維尼和其他人，因為是明天的事？”</p>
    <p data-start="89.06" data-end="105.76">"Oh, it will, will it?" said Owl, still being as helpful as possible. "So will you go and tell them, Owl?" Owl tried to think of something very wise to say, but couldn't, so he flew off to tell the others. And the first person he told was Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="89.06" data-end="105.76">“哦，真的嗎？”貓頭鷹仍然盡量保持幫忙的態度說。“那你能去告訴他們嗎，貓頭鷹？”貓頭鷹試著想一些非常智慧的話來說，但想不出來，所以他飛去告訴其他人。第一個被告知的是小熊維尼。</p>
    <p data-start="107.04" data-end="122.16">"Pooh," he said, "Christopher Robin is giving a party." "Oh!" said Pooh And then seeing that Owl expected him to say something else, he said, "Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar icing?"</p>
    <p data-start="107.04" data-end="122.16">“小熊維尼，”貓頭鷹說，“克里斯多福·羅賓正在舉辦一個派對。” “哦！”小熊維尼說。看到貓頭鷹期待他說些別的，他接著問，“會有那些粉紅糖霜的小蛋糕嗎？”</p>
    <p data-start="123.64" data-end="133.54">Owl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things with pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin had said, and flew off to Eeyore.</p>
    <p data-start="123.64" data-end="133.54">貓頭鷹覺得談論粉紅糖霜的小蛋糕有點低俗，所以他告訴小熊維尼克里斯多福·羅賓說的話，然後飛往驢子。</p>
    <p data-start="134.94" data-end="163.30">"Party for Me?" thought Pooh to himself. "How grand!" And he began to wonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special Pooh Party, and if Christopher Robin had told them about The Floating Bear and the Brain of Pooh, and all the wonderful ships he had invented and sailed on, and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had forgotten about it, and nobody quite knewwhat the party was for;</p>
    <p data-start="134.94" data-end="163.30">“為我舉辦的派對？”小熊維尼心想。“真是太棒了！”他開始想像其他動物是否會知道這是特別為小熊維尼舉辦的派對，是否克里斯多福·羅賓告訴他們關於浮動的熊和小熊維尼的智慧大腦，還有他發明和航行過的所有奇妙船隻，他開始擔心如果大家都忘記了，沒有人知道這個派對的目的會有多糟糕；</p>
    <p data-start="163.86" data-end="170.24">and the more he thought like this, the more the party got muddled in his mind, like a dream when nothing goes right.</p>
    <p data-start="163.86" data-end="170.24">他越是這麼想，派對在他的腦海中就越顯得混亂，像一場什麼都不對的夢。</p>
    <p data-start="171.30" data-end="180.16">And the dream began to sing itself over in his head until it became a sort of song. It was an ANXIOUS POOH SONG.</p>
    <p data-start="171.30" data-end="180.16">這個夢在他的腦海中唱著，直到它變成了一首歌。那是一首焦慮的小熊維尼之歌。</p>
    <p data-start="181.28" data-end="209.12">3 Cheers for Pooh (For Who?) For Pooh-- (Why what did he do?) I thought you knew; He saved his friend from a wetting! 3 Cheers for Bear! (For where?) For Bear-- He couldn't swim, But he rescued him! (He rescued who?) Oh, listen, do! I am talking of Pooh? (Of who?) Of Pooh!</p>
    <p data-start="181.28" data-end="209.12">為小熊維尼喝三聲彩（為誰？）為小熊維尼--（他做了什麼？）我以為你知道；他救了他的朋友免於淹水！ 為熊喝三聲彩！（在哪裡？）為熊-- 他不會游泳，但他救了他！（他救了誰？）哦，聽我說！我在說小熊維尼？（誰？）小熊維尼！</p>
    <p data-start="209.86" data-end="239.34">(I'm sorry I keep forgetting). Well. Pooh was a Bear of Enormous Brain-- (Just say it again!) Of enormous brain-- (Of enormous what?) Well, he ate a lot, And I don't know if he could swim or not, But he managed to float On a sort of boat (On a sort of what?) Well, a sort of pot-- So now let's give him three hearty cheers (So now let's give him three hearty whitches?)</p>
    <p data-start="209.86" data-end="239.34">（對不起，我總是忘記）。好了。小熊維尼是一隻擁有巨大智慧的大熊--（再說一遍！）擁有巨大智慧的熊--（巨大智慧是什麼？）好吧，他吃了很多，我不知道他是否會游泳，但他設法在一種船上漂浮（什麼船？）好吧，一種鍋子--所以現在讓我們為他熱情地喝三聲彩（現在讓我們為他熱情地喝三聲彩？）</p>
    <p data-start="240.62" data-end="257.34">And hope he'll be with us for years and years, And grow in health and wisdom and riches! 3 Cheers for Pooh! (For who?) For Pooh-- 3 Cheers for Bear (For where?) For Bear-- 3 Cheers for the wonderful Winnie-the-Pooh! (Just tell me, somebody--WHAT DID HE DO?)</p>
    <p data-start="240.62" data-end="257.34">希望他能與我們相伴多年，並在健康、智慧和財富上有所成長！為小熊維尼喝三聲彩！（為誰？）為小熊維尼-- 為熊喝三聲彩！（在哪裡？）為熊-- 為了了不起的小熊維尼喝三聲彩！（快告訴我，有人—他做了什麼？）</p>
    <p data-start="266.78" data-end="279.34">While this was going on inside him, Owl was talking to Eeyore. "Eeyore," said Owl, "Christopher Robin is giving a party."</p>
    <p data-start="266.78" data-end="279.34">在這段時間，貓頭鷹正在和驢子對話。“驢子，”貓頭鷹說，“克里斯多福·羅賓正在舉辦一個派對。”</p>
    <p data-start="281.18" data-end="304.34">Very interesting. Said Eor. I suppose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trotten on. Kind and thoughtful. Not at all. Don't mention it. There is an invitation for you. What's that like? And invitation. Yes, I heard you. Who dropped it? This is an invitation.</p>
    <p data-start="281.18" data-end="304.34">“非常有趣。”驢子說。“我想他們會把被踩過的零碎東西送給我。真是親切和體貼。根本不用提。有一張邀請函給你。那是什麼？”“邀請函。” “是的，我聽到了。誰丟的？”“這不是食物，它是在邀請你參加派對。明天。”驢子慢慢搖了搖頭。</p>
    <p data-start="304.46" data-end="315.98">"Very interesting," said Eeyore. "I suppose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all, don't mention it." "There is an Invitation for you." "What's that like?" "An Invitation!" "Yes, I heard you. Who dropped it?" "This isn't anything to eat, it's asking you to the party. To-morrow." Eeyore shook his head slowly.</p>
    <p data-start="304.46" data-end="315.98">“你是說小豬皮傑，那個耳朵很興奮的小家伙。那就是小豬皮傑。我會告訴他的。” “不，不！”貓頭鷹說，變得相當急躁。“是你！”</p>
    <p data-start="317.06" data-end="331.98">"You mean Piglet. The little fellow with the exited ears. That's Piglet. I'll tell him." "No, no!" said Owl, getting quite fussy. "It's you!"</p>
    <p data-start="317.06" data-end="331.98">“你是說小豬皮傑。那隻耳朵很興奮的小傢伙。那就是小豬皮傑。我會告訴他的。” “不，不！”貓頭鷹說，變得有些急躁。“是你！”</p>
    <p data-start="333.26" data-end="347.56">"Are you sure?" "Of course I'm sure. Christopher Robin said 'All of them! Tell all of them.'" "All of them, except Eeyore?" "All of them," said Owl sulkily.</p>
    <p data-start="333.26" data-end="347.56">“你確定嗎？” “當然確定。克里斯多福·羅賓說‘所有人！告訴所有人。’” “所有人，除了驢子？” “所有人，”貓頭鷹不情願地說。</p>
    <p data-start="348.42" data-end="378.30">"Ah!" said Eeyore. "A mistake, no doubt, but still, I shall come. Only don't blame me if it rains." But it didn't rain. Christopher Robin had made a long table out of some long pieces of wood, and they all sat round it. Christopher Robin sat at one end, and Pooh sat at the other, and between them on one side were Owl and Eeyore and Piglet,</p>
    <p data-start="348.42" data-end="378.30">“啊！”驢子說。“肯定是個錯誤，但我還是會去。只是如果下雨就別怪我。”但並沒有下雨。克里斯多福·羅賓用一些長木板搭了一張長桌，大家圍著它坐。克里斯多福·羅賓坐在一端，小熊維尼坐在另一端，在他們中間的一邊是貓頭鷹、驢子和小豬皮傑，</p>
    <p data-start="378.36" data-end="408.18">and between them on the other side were Rabbit, and Roo and Kanga. And all Rabbit's friends and relations spread themselves about on the grass, and waited hopefully in case anybody spoke to them, or dropped anything, or asked them the time. It was the first party to which Roo had ever been, and he was very excited. As soon as ever they had sat down he began to talk. "Hallo, Pooh!" he squeaked. "Hallo, Roo!" said Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="378.36" data-end="408.18">在他們的另一邊是兔子、小袋鼠和袋鼠媽媽。兔子的朋友和親戚們散落在草地上，期待有人跟他們打招呼，或者掉落什麼東西，或者問他們時間。這是小袋鼠第一次參加派對，他非常興奮。大家一坐下來，他就開始說話。“你好，小熊維尼！”他尖叫著說。“你好，小袋鼠！”小熊維尼說。</p>
    <p data-start="408.36" data-end="438.30">Roo jumped up and down in his seat for a little while and then began again. "Hallo, Piglet!" he squeaked. Piglet waved a paw at him, being too busy to say anything. "Hallo, Eeyore!" said Roo. Eeyore nodded gloomily at him. "It will rain soon, you see if it doesn't," he said. Roo looked to see if it didn't, and it didn't, so he said</p>
    <p data-start="408.36" data-end="438.30">小袋鼠在座位上跳來跳去了一會兒，然後再次開始說話。“你好，小豬皮傑！”他尖叫著。小豬皮傑揮了揮爪子，因為太忙了沒法說話。“你好，驢子！”小袋鼠說。驢子陰沉地點了點頭。“你看，很快就會下雨的，”他說。小袋鼠看了一眼天，沒有下雨，所以他說：</p>
    <p data-start="439.04" data-end="467.88">"Hallo, Owl!"--and Owl said "Hallo, my little fellow," in a kindly way, and went on telling Christopher Robin about an accident which had nearly happened to a friend of his whom Christopher Robin didn't know, and Kanga said to Roo, "Drink up your milk first, dear, and talk afterwards." So Roo, who was drinking his milk, tried to say that he could do both at once . . . and had to be patted on the back and dried for quite a long time afterwards.</p>
    <p data-start="439.04" data-end="467.88">“你好，貓頭鷹！”——貓頭鷹以親切的方式說“你好，我的小家伙”，然後繼續告訴克里斯多福·羅賓一個差點發生在他的朋友身上的事故，這位朋友是克里斯多福·羅賓不認識的，而袋鼠媽媽對小袋鼠說：“先喝完你的牛奶，親愛的，然後再說話。”所以正在喝牛奶的小袋鼠試圖說他可以一邊喝一邊說話……結果被拍了拍背，擦乾了好一會兒。</p>
    <p data-start="470.00" data-end="485.50">When they had all nearly eaten enough, Christopher Robin banged on the table with his spoon, and everybody stopped talking and was very silent, except Roo who was just finishing a loud attack of hiccups and trying to look as if it was one of Rabbit's relations.</p>
    <p data-start="470.00" data-end="485.50">當大家幾乎吃夠了，克里斯多福·羅賓用湯匙敲了敲桌子，大家都停止了說話，非常安靜，只有小袋鼠剛好完成了一次響亮的打嗝，並試圖看起來像是兔子的親戚。</p>
    <p data-start="487.12" data-end="512.52">"This party," said Christopher Robin, "is a party because of what someone did, and we all know who it was, and it's his party, because of what he did, and I've got a present for him and here it is." Then he felt about a little and whispered, "Where is it?" While he was looking, Eeyore coughed in an impressive way and began to speak.</p>
    <p data-start="487.12" data-end="512.52">“這次派對，”克里斯多福·羅賓說，“是因為某人做了一件事，我們都知道那是誰，這是他的派對，因為他做了那件事，我有一份禮物送給他，這就是它。” 然後他摸了摸，低聲說：“它在哪裡？”在他尋找的時候，驢子以引人注目的方式咳嗽了一下，開始說話。</p>
    <p data-start="514.16" data-end="529.98">"Friends," he said, "including oddments, it is a great pleasure, or perhaps I had better say it has been a pleasure so far, to see you at my party.</p>
    <p data-start="514.16" data-end="529.98">“朋友們，”他說，“包括零碎的東西，很高興，或者說到目前為止很高興，見到你們來我的派對。</p>
    <p data-start="531.36" data-end="550.98">What I did was nothing. Any of you-except Rabbit and Owl and Kanga--would have done the same. Oh, and Pooh. My remarks do not, of course, apply to Piglet and Roo, because they are too small.</p>
    <p data-start="531.36" data-end="550.98">我所做的沒什麼。你們任何人——除了兔子、貓頭鷹和袋鼠媽媽——都會做同樣的事。哦，還有小熊維尼。我的話當然不適用於小豬皮傑和小袋鼠，因為他們太小了。</p>
    <p data-start="552.36" data-end="560.26">Any of you would have done the same. But it just happened to be Me. It was not, I need hardly say,</p>
    <p data-start="552.36" data-end="560.26">你們任何人都會做同樣的事。但偏偏是我。這不是，我幾乎不需要說，</p>
    <p data-start="560.40" data-end="567.66">with an idea of getting what Christopher Robin is looking for now"--and he put his front leg to his mouth and said in a loud whisper,</p>
    <p data-start="560.40" data-end="567.66">“帶著找克里斯多福·羅賓現在尋找的東西的想法”——他把前腿放到嘴邊，用大聲的低語說，</p>
    <p data-start="567.66" data-end="576.98">"Try under the table"--"that I did what I did--</p>
    <p data-start="567.66" data-end="576.98">“試試桌子下面”——“我做了我做的事——</p>
    <p data-start="577.00" data-end="591.98">but because I feel that we should all do what we can to help. I feel that we should all----" "H--hup!" said Roo accidentally. "Roo, dear!" said Kanga reproachfully. "Was it me?"</p>
    <p data-start="577.00" data-end="591.98">但因為我覺得我們都應該盡力幫忙。我覺得我們都——” “哈——哈！”小袋鼠不小心打斷了。 “小袋鼠，親愛的！”袋鼠媽媽責備地說。“是我嗎？”</p>
    <p data-start="592.62" data-end="603.84">asked Roo, a little surprised. "What's Eeyore talking about?" Piglet whispered to Pooh. "I don't know," said Pooh rather dolefully. "I thought this was your party."</p>
    <p data-start="592.62" data-end="603.84">小袋鼠有點驚訝地問。“驢子在說什麼？”小豬皮傑對小熊維尼低聲說。“我不知道，”小熊維尼有些沮喪地說。“我以為這是你的派對。”</p>
    <p data-start="605.16" data-end="618.96">"I thought it was once. But I suppose it isn't." "I'd sooner it was yours than Eeyore's," said Piglet. "So would I," said Pooh. "H--hup!" said Roo again.</p>
    <p data-start="605.16" data-end="618.96">“我曾經以為是的。但我想不是了。” “我寧願是你的派對而不是驢子的，”小豬皮傑說。“我也是，”小熊維尼說。“哈——哈！”小袋鼠再次喊道。</p>
    <p data-start="621.02" data-end="647.60">"AS--I--WAS--SAYING," said Eeyore loudly and sternly, "as I was saying when was interrupted by various Loud Sounds, I feel that--" "Here it is!" cried Christopher Robin excitedly. "Pass it down to silly old Pooh. It's for Pooh." "For Pooh?" said Eeyore.</p>
    <p data-start="621.02" data-end="647.60">“正如——我——剛才——說的，”驢子大聲且嚴厲地說，“正如我剛才被各種聲音打斷時所說的，我覺得——” “在這裡！”克里斯多福·羅賓興奮地喊道。“把它傳給可憐的小熊維尼。這是給小熊維尼的。” “給小熊維尼？”驢子說。</p>
    <p data-start="649.16" data-end="676.72">"Of course it is. The best bear in all the world." "I might have known," said Eeyore. "After all, one can't complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. And was it last week or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said 'Bother!' The Social Round.</p>
    <p data-start="649.16" data-end="676.72">“當然是。全世界最棒的熊。” “我早該知道的，”驢子說。“畢竟，無可抱怨。我有我的朋友。昨天還有人跟我說話。還是上週還是前週，兔子碰到了我，說了‘麻煩！’社交圈。”</p>
    <p data-start="677.96" data-end="691.68">Always something going on." Nobody was listening, for they were all saying, "Open it, Pooh," "What is it, Pooh?" "I know what it is," "No, you don't,"</p>
    <p data-start="677.96" data-end="691.68">“總是有事情發生。”沒有人在聽，因為他們都在說，“打開它，小熊維尼，” “那是什麼，小熊維尼？” “我知道那是什麼，” “不，你不知道，”</p>
    <p data-start="692.12" data-end="705.12">and other helpful remarks of this sort. And of course Pooh was opening it as quickly as ever he could, but without cutting the string, because you never know when a bit of string might be Useful. At last it was undone.</p>
    <p data-start="692.12" data-end="705.12">以及其他類似的有幫助的話。當然，小熊維尼正以最快的速度打開包裹，但不剪斷繩子，因為你永遠不知道繩子上的一段可能會有用。最後，它終於被打開了。</p>
    <p data-start="706.22" data-end="732.78">When Pooh saw what it was, he nearly fell down, he was so pleased. It was a Special Pencil Case. There were pencils in it marked "B" for Bear, and pencils marked "HB " for Helping Bear, and pencils marked "BB" for Brave Bear. There was a knife for sharpening the pencils, and indiarubber for rubbing out anything which you had spelt wrong,</p>
    <p data-start="706.22" data-end="732.78">當小熊維尼看到裡面的東西時，他高興得差點摔倒。那是一個特製的鉛筆盒。裡面有標記為“B”的鉛筆，代表“熊”，標記為“HB”的鉛筆，代表“幫助熊”，還有標記為“BB”的鉛筆，代表“勇敢熊”。還有一把用來削鉛筆的刀子，橡皮擦用來擦掉你拼錯的字，</p>
    <p data-start="733.38" data-end="741.14">and a ruler for ruling lines for the words to walk on, and inches marked on the ruler in case you wanted to know how many inches anything was,</p>
    <p data-start="733.38" data-end="741.14">還有一把尺子，用來劃線讓單詞走在上面，尺子上還標記了英寸，以防你想知道任何東西的長度，</p>
    <p data-start="742.12" data-end="748.70">and Blue Pencils and Red Pencils and Green Pencils for saying special things in blue and red and green.</p>
    <p data-start="742.12" data-end="748.70">還有藍色鉛筆、紅色鉛筆和綠色鉛筆，用來用藍色、紅色和綠色寫特殊的東西。</p>
    <p data-start="750.42" data-end="760.42">And all these lovely things were in little pockets of their own in a Special Case which shut with a click when you clicked it. And they were all for Pooh.</p>
    <p data-start="750.42" data-end="760.42">所有這些美妙的東西都放在一個特製的盒子裡，每個小口袋裡都有自己的小東西，當你按下去時，盒子會“咔嚓”一聲關上。而這一切都是為小熊維尼準備的。</p>
    <p data-start="761.88" data-end="791.86">"Oh!" said Pooh. "Oh, Pooh!" said everybody else except Eeyore. "Thank-you," growled Pooh. But Eeyore was saying to himself, "This writing business. Pencils and what-not. Over-rated, if you ask me. Silly stuff. Nothing in it." Later on, when they had all said "Good-bye" and "Thank-you" to Christopher Robin, Pooh and Piglet walked home thoughtfully together in the golden evening,</p>
    <p data-start="761.88" data-end="791.86">“哦！”小熊維尼說。“哦，小熊維尼！”除了驢子以外，大家都這樣說。“謝謝你，”小熊維尼咆哮著說。但驢子自言自語道：“這寫字的事，鉛筆什麼的，真的被過度評價了，如果你問我的話。這些都是愚蠢的東西，沒有什麼實質的。”後來，當大家對克里斯多福·羅賓說完“再見”和“謝謝”後，小熊維尼和小豬皮傑在金色的黃昏中沉思地一起走回家，</p>
    <p data-start="791.94" data-end="799.04">and for a long time they were silent. "When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,"</p>
    <p data-start="791.94" data-end="799.04">他們靜靜地走了很長一段時間。“早上醒來時，小熊維尼，”</p>
    <p data-start="799.28" data-end="803.36">said Piglet at last, "what's the first thing you say to yourself?"</p>
    <p data-start="799.28" data-end="803.36">小豬皮傑終於說，“你對自己說的第一句話是什麼？”</p>
    <p data-start="805.14" data-end="812.18">"What's for breakfast?" said Pooh. "What do you say, Piglet?" "I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting to-day?" said Piglet.</p>
    <p data-start="805.14" data-end="812.18">“早餐吃什麼？”小熊維尼說。“你呢，小豬皮傑？” “我說，我想知道今天會發生什麼令人興奮的事情？”小豬皮傑說。</p>
    <p data-start="812.40" data-end="823.22">Pooh nodded thoughtfully. "It's the same thing," he said. "And what did happen?"</p>
    <p data-start="812.40" data-end="823.22">小熊維尼若有所思地點了點頭。“那是一樣的，”他說。“那麼，發生了什麼事？”</p>
    <p data-start="823.38" data-end="831.62">asked Christopher Robin. "When?" "Next morning." "I don't know." "Could you think, and tell me and Pooh some time?"</p>
    <p data-start="823.38" data-end="831.62">克里斯多福·羅賓問。“什麼時候？” “第二天早上。” “我不知道。” “你能思考一下，然後告訴我和小熊維尼嗎？”</p>
    <p data-start="832.62" data-end="840.82">"If you wanted it very much." "Pooh does," said Christopher Robin. He gave a deep sigh, picked his bear up by the leg and walked off to the door,</p>
    <p data-start="832.62" data-end="840.82">“如果你非常想知道的話。” “小熊維尼很想知道，”克里斯多福·羅賓說。他深深地嘆了口氣，抓起小熊維尼的腿，走向門口，</p>
    <p data-start="840.84" data-end="867.82">trailing Winnie-the-Pooh behind him. At the door he turned and said, "Coming to see me have my bath?" "I might," I said. "Was Pooh's pencil case any better than mine?" "It was just the same," I said. He nodded and went out . . . and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh--bump, bump, bump--going up the stairs behind him.</p>
    <p data-start="840.84" data-end="867.82">拖著小熊維尼在後面。在門口，他轉身說：“要來看我洗澡嗎？” “我可能會的，”我說。“小熊維尼的鉛筆盒比我的好嗎？” “是一樣的，”我說。他點了點頭，走了出去……片刻後，我聽到小熊維尼——咚、咚、咚——在樓梯上跟在他後面。</p>
