    <p data-start="14.78" data-end="16.84" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十九章：被戰鬥樹攻擊</p>
    <p data-start="18.62" data-end="47.76">The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them.</p>
    <p data-start="18.62" data-end="47.76">第二天早晨，桃樂絲向那位漂亮的綠色女孩告別，大家與那位綠鬍子的士兵握手道別，他陪伴他們走到門口。當守門人再次見到他們時，他非常驚訝他們竟然能夠離開美麗的城市去面對新的麻煩。但他立刻打開了他們的眼鏡，把它們放回綠色的盒子裡，並送上了許多祝福，讓他們帶著這些祝福出發。</p>
    <p data-start="47.76" data-end="61.98">"You are now our ruler," he said to the Scarecrow; "so you must come back to us as soon as possible." "I certainly shall if I am able," the Scarecrow replied; "but I must help Dorothy to get home, first."</p>
    <p data-start="47.76" data-end="61.98">“現在你是我們的統治者，”他對稻草人說，“所以你必須儘快回來。”稻草人回答說：“如果可能的話，我一定會回來的；但我必須先幫助桃樂絲回家。”</p>
    <p data-start="62.20" data-end="76.50">As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said: "I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am."</p>
    <p data-start="62.20" data-end="76.50">當桃樂絲向和藹可親的守門人作最後告別時，她說：“我在你們美麗的城市受到了非常友好的對待，每個人都對我很好。我無法形容我有多麼感激。”</p>
    <p data-start="76.98" data-end="89.78">"Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a way." He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth and started upon their journey.</p>
    <p data-start="76.98" data-end="89.78">“親愛的，不用試著表達，”他回答說。“我們很想讓你留在我們這裡，但如果你想回到堪薩斯，我希望你能找到辦法。”隨後，他打開了外牆的大門，他們走了出去，開始了他們的旅程。</p>
    <p data-start="91.38" data-end="108.54">The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her.</p>
    <p data-start="91.38" data-end="108.54">當我們的朋友們將面朝南方的土地時，陽光燦爛。他們心情愉快，互相歡笑交談。桃樂絲再次充滿了回家的希望，而稻草人和鐵皮人也很高興能幫助她。</p>
    <p data-start="108.74" data-end="145.54">As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking merrily all the time. "City life does not agree with me at all," remarked the Lion, as they walked along at a brisk pace. "I have lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown." They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City.</p>
    <p data-start="108.74" data-end="145.54">至於獅子，他愉快地嗅著新鮮的空氣，純粹因為再次置身於鄉村而搖擺著尾巴，而托托在他們周圍跑來跑去，快樂地追逐著飛蛾和蝴蝶，不停地吠叫。“城市生活根本不適合我，”獅子一邊走一邊說。“我在那裡瘦了很多，現在我急於向其他野獸展示我變得多麼勇敢。”他們現在轉過身來，最後一次看向翡翠城。</p>
    <p data-start="145.66" data-end="171.46">All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz. "Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all," said the Tin Woodman, as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast. "He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="145.66" data-end="171.46">他們只能看到綠牆後面的一片塔樓和尖頂，以及高高在上的奧茲宮殿的尖塔和圓頂。“奧茲畢竟也不是那麼壞的巫師，”鐵皮人說，感覺到心臟在胸口咯咯作響。“他知道怎麼給我智慧，而且智慧非常好，”稻草人說。</p>
    <p data-start="171.58" data-end="192.70">"If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me," added the Lion, "he would have been a brave man." Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he had done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a bad Wizard.</p>
    <p data-start="171.58" data-end="192.70">“如果奧茲能得到和他給我一樣的勇氣，”獅子補充說，“他會成為一個勇敢的人。”桃樂絲什麼也沒說。奧茲沒有履行對她的承諾，但他已經盡了最大努力，所以她原諒了他。正如他所說，他是一個好人，即使他是一個糟糕的巫師。</p>
    <p data-start="194.12" data-end="230.38">The first day's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well indeed. In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.</p>
    <p data-start="194.12" data-end="230.38">第一天的旅行經過了圍繞翡翠城的綠色田野和鮮艷花朵。他們那晚在草地上睡覺，頭頂上只有星星；他們休息得非常好。第二天早晨，他們繼續前行，直到來到一片濃密的森林。這片森林無法繞過，因為它似乎向右和向左延伸，遠及他們所能見的地方；而且，他們不敢改變行進的方向，害怕迷路。因此，他們尋找最容易進入森林的地方。</p>
    <p data-start="231.68" data-end="256.12">The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.</p>
    <p data-start="231.68" data-end="256.12">領頭的稻草人最終發現了一棵大樹，它的枝條伸展得非常寬，足以讓隊伍通過。因此，他向樹走去，但當他剛走到第一根樹枝下時，那些樹枝彎下來纏繞住他，下一刻他被抬離地面，頭朝下地拋向他的夥伴們。</p>
    <p data-start="256.92" data-end="262.84">This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.</p>
    <p data-start="256.92" data-end="262.84">這對稻草人沒有造成傷害，但讓他感到驚訝，當桃樂絲把他撿起來時，他看起來有些暈眩。</p>
    <p data-start="263.50" data-end="266.40">"Here is another space between the trees," called the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="263.50" data-end="266.40">“這裡有另一個空隙，”獅子叫道。</p>
    <p data-start="267.18" data-end="289.82">"Let me try it first," said the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt me to get thrown about." He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again. "This is strange," exclaimed Dorothy. "What shall we do?" "The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our journey," remarked the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="267.18" data-end="289.82">“讓我先試試，”稻草人說，“因為被拋來拋去對我沒有什麼傷害。”他走向另一棵樹，但樹枝立即抓住他，把他再度拋了回去。“這真奇怪，”桃樂絲驚呼道。“我們該怎麼辦？”“樹似乎決心要跟我們打架，阻止我們的旅程，”獅子說。</p>
    <p data-start="290.40" data-end="315.74">"I believe I will try it myself," said the Woodman, and shouldering his axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.</p>
    <p data-start="290.40" data-end="315.74">“我想我自己來試試，”鐵皮人說，肩起斧頭，走向第一棵對稻草人如此粗暴的樹。當一根大樹枝彎下來抓住他時，鐵皮人猛烈地砍向它，把它劈成兩半。樹立刻開始劇烈搖晃所有的枝條，彷彿在疼痛中，鐵皮人安全地從樹下通過。</p>
    <p data-start="316.50" data-end="333.44">"Come on!" he shouted to the others. "Be quick!" They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.</p>
    <p data-start="316.50" data-end="333.44">“快來！”他對其他人喊道。“快點！”他們都跑過去，安全地從樹下通過，除了托托被一根小樹枝抓住，搖擺得吠叫不止。但鐵皮人立即砍掉了那根樹枝，讓小狗獲得了自由。</p>
    <p data-start="334.12" data-end="367.10">The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it. The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads. "What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy. "I will make a ladder,"</p>
    <p data-start="334.12" data-end="367.10">森林中的其他樹木沒有阻擋他們，所以他們認為只有第一排樹木可以彎下枝條，這些樹可能是森林的警察，被賦予了這種奇妙的力量以防止陌生人進入。他們輕鬆地穿過樹林，直到來到森林的另一邊。然後，他們驚訝地發現面前是一堵看似由白色瓷器製成的高牆。牆面光滑得像盤子一樣，高於他們的頭部。“我們現在該怎麼辦？”桃樂絲問。“我會造一架梯子，”</p>
    <p data-start="367.70" data-end="381.98">said the Tin Woodman, "for we certainly must climb over the wall."</p>
    <p data-start="367.70" data-end="381.98">鐵皮人說，“我們肯定得爬過這堵牆。”</p>
