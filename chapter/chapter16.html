    <p data-start="15.48" data-end="17.98" style="margin-left: 35%;">Chapter 16: The Magic Art of the Great Humbug</p>
    <p data-start="15.48" data-end="17.98" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十六章：大騙子的神奇伎倆</p>
  
    <p data-start="19.22" data-end="34.14">Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends: "Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I return I shall be as other men are." "I have always liked you as you were," said Dorothy simply.</p>
    <p data-start="19.22" data-end="34.14">第二天早上，稻草人對他的朋友們說：「恭喜我吧，我終於要去奧茲獲得我的大腦了。當我回來時，我將會像其他人一樣。」 「我一直喜歡原本的你。」桃樂絲簡單地說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="34.14" data-end="53.88">"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow," he replied. "But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out." Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.</p>
    <p data-start="34.14" data-end="53.88">「你喜歡一個稻草人真是太好了。」他回答道。「但是當你聽到我的新大腦將要產生的精彩想法時，你肯定會更喜歡我。」 然後他愉快地向大家告別，走向寶座室，在那裡他敲了敲門。</p>
  
    <p data-start="54.22" data-end="60.86">"Come in," said Oz. The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window, engaged in deep thought.</p>
    <p data-start="54.22" data-end="60.86">「進來吧，」奧茲說。稻草人走了進去，發現那個小人正坐在窗邊，陷入了沉思。</p>
  
    <p data-start="62.18" data-end="70.52">"I have come for my brains," remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily. "Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Oz.</p>
    <p data-start="62.18" data-end="70.52">「我來拿我的大腦，」稻草人有點不安地說。 「哦，是的；請坐在那把椅子上，」奧茲回答。</p>
  
    <p data-start="71.48" data-end="77.52">"You must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place."</p>
    <p data-start="71.48" data-end="77.52">「請原諒我把你的頭摘下來，但我必須這樣做才能把你的大腦放到正確的位置。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="78.38" data-end="85.98">"That's all right," said the Scarecrow. "You are quite welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again."</p>
    <p data-start="78.38" data-end="85.98">「沒關係，」稻草人說。「只要你把它重新裝上時變得更好，你隨時可以把我的頭拿下來。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="87.14" data-end="107.72">So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.</p>
    <p data-start="87.14" data-end="107.72">於是巫師解開了稻草人的頭，把稻草倒了出來。然後他走進後面的房間，拿出一些麩皮，與許多針和別針混合在一起。將它們徹底混合後，他把混合物裝進稻草人的頭頂，並用稻草填充剩餘的空間，以固定它的位置。</p>
  
    <p data-start="108.46" data-end="139.64">When he had fastened the Scarecrow's head on his body again he said to him, "Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains." The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends. Dorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the top with brains. "How do you feel?" she asked.</p>
    <p data-start="108.46" data-end="139.64">當他把稻草人的頭重新安裝到他的身體上時，他對稻草人說：「從今以後，你將成為一個偉大的人，因為我給了你許多全新的大腦。」稻草人對於他最大願望的實現感到既高興又自豪，並熱情地感謝了奧茲，然後回到了他的朋友們身邊。桃樂絲好奇地看著他。他的頭頂因為大腦而鼓起來了。「你感覺怎麼樣？」她問道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="140.56" data-end="157.46">"I feel wise indeed," he answered earnestly. "When I get used to my brains I shall know everything." "Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?" asked the Tin Woodman. "That is proof that he is sharp," remarked the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="140.56" data-end="157.46">「我確實感覺很聰明，」他認真地回答。「當我習慣了我的大腦後，我將無所不知。」 「為什麼那些針和別針從你的頭上冒出來？」鐵皮人問。 「那是他敏銳的證明，」獅子說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="158.12" data-end="164.16">"Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart," said the Woodman. So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.</p>
    <p data-start="158.12" data-end="164.16">「那麼，我必須去找奧茲拿我的心，」鐵皮人說。於是他走到寶座室，敲了敲門。</p>
  
    <p data-start="165.04" data-end="170.26">"Come in," called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, "I have come for my heart."</p>
    <p data-start="165.04" data-end="170.26">「進來吧，」奧茲叫道，鐵皮人走了進去，說：「我來拿我的心。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="171.32" data-end="179.20">"Very well," answered the little man. "But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it won't hurt you."</p>
    <p data-start="171.32" data-end="179.20">「很好，」那個小人回答道。「但是我得在你的胸口切一個洞，這樣我才能把你的心放在正確的位置。我希望這不會傷到你。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="179.22" data-end="207.16">"Oh, no," answered the Woodman. "I shall not feel it at all." So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith's shears and cut a small, square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman's breast. Then, going to a chest of drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust. "Isn't it a beauty?" he asked. "It is, indeed!" replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased.</p>
    <p data-start="179.22" data-end="207.16">「哦，不，」鐵皮人回答道。「我完全不會感覺到。」於是奧茲拿來一把錫匠的剪刀，在鐵皮人的左胸切了一個小方洞。然後，他走到一個抽屜櫃前，取出了一顆漂亮的心，完全由絲綢製成，裡面填滿了鋸末。「它不是很漂亮嗎？」他問。「確實如此！」鐵皮人回答，他非常高興。</p>
  
    <p data-start="207.72" data-end="237.18">"But is it a kind heart?" "Oh, very!" answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman's breast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it had been cut. "There," said he; "now you have a heart that any man might be proud of. I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn't be helped." "Never mind the patch," exclaimed the happy Woodman. "I am very grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness."</p>
    <p data-start="207.72" data-end="237.18">「但它是一顆善良的心嗎？」 「哦，非常善良！」奧茲回答。他把心放進鐵皮人的胸膛，然後把那塊錫片放回原處，並在切口處整齊地焊接好。「好了，」他說；「現在你有了一顆任何人都會引以為豪的心。我很抱歉不得不在你的胸口打上一塊補丁，但這真的是無法避免的。」 「不要介意那塊補丁，」快樂的鐵皮人喊道。「我非常感激你，永遠不會忘記你的善意。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="237.30" data-end="251.54">"Don't speak of it," replied Oz. Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune. The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.</p>
    <p data-start="237.30" data-end="251.54">「別提了，」奧茲回答道。然後鐵皮人回到了他的朋友們身邊，朋友們為他的好運祝福他。現在獅子走到寶座室，敲了敲門。</p>
  
    <p data-start="251.74" data-end="259.50">"Come in," said Oz. "I have come for my courage," announced the Lion, entering the room.</p>
    <p data-start="251.74" data-end="259.50">「進來吧，」奧茲說。「我來拿我的勇氣，」獅子走進房間宣布道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="260.08" data-end="281.70">"Very well," answered the little man; "I will get it for you." He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it,</p>
    <p data-start="260.08" data-end="281.70">「很好，」那個小人回答道；「我會給你拿來。」他走到一個櫥櫃，伸手從高架子上取下一個方形綠瓶，將瓶中的內容物倒入一個精美雕刻的綠金色碟子中。把這放在膽小獅子面前，獅子聞了聞，好像不喜歡它似的。</p>
  
    <p data-start="282.30" data-end="291.58">the Wizard said: "Drink." "What is it?" asked the Lion. "Well," answered Oz, "if it were inside of you, it would be courage.</p>
    <p data-start="282.30" data-end="291.58">巫師說：「喝了它。」 「這是什麼？」獅子問。 「嗯，」奧茲回答，「如果它在你體內，那就是勇氣。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="292.34" data-end="300.16">You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it.</p>
    <p data-start="292.34" data-end="300.16">你知道，當然，勇氣總是在一個人內心的；所以這在你吞下它之前，真的不能稱為勇氣。</p>
  
    <p data-start="300.92" data-end="308.82">Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible." The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.</p>
    <p data-start="300.92" data-end="308.82">所以我建議你儘快喝下它。」獅子不再猶豫，直到把碟子喝空。</p>
  
    <p data-start="309.80" data-end="319.60">"How do you feel now?" asked Oz. "Full of courage," replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune.</p>
    <p data-start="309.80" data-end="319.60">「你現在感覺如何？」奧茲問。 「充滿勇氣，」獅子回答，他快樂地回到朋友們身邊，告訴他們他的好運。</p>
  
    <p data-start="320.02" data-end="355.10">Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. "How can I help being a humbug," he said, "when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can't be done? It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I'm sure I don't know how it can be done."</p>
    <p data-start="320.02" data-end="355.10">奧茲獨自留下，想到他成功地給了稻草人、鐵皮人和獅子他們認為想要的東西，不禁笑了起來。「當所有這些人讓我做每個人都知道無法完成的事情時，我怎能不成為一個騙子呢？」他說，「讓稻草人、獅子和鐵皮人高興很容易，因為他們想像我可以做任何事。但要把桃樂絲帶回堪薩斯，需要的不僅僅是想像力，而且我確實不知道這該怎麼做。」</p>
