    <p data-start="12.92" data-end="14.04" style="margin-left: 35%;">Chapter 14: The Winged Monkeys</p>
    <p data-start="12.92" data-end="14.04" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十四章：有翅膀的猴子。</p>

    <p data-start="15.14" data-end="67.82">You will remember there was no road--not even a pathway-- between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning-- all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="15.14" data-end="67.82">你會記得，在邪惡女巫的城堡和翡翠城之間沒有道路——甚至沒有小徑。當四位旅行者去尋找女巫時，她看見他們來了，所以派了有翅膀的猴子把他們帶到她那裡。比起被攜帶，找到回到大片黃水仙和黃雛菊田野的路要難得多。他們當然知道，他們必須一直往東走，朝著升起的太陽前進；他們開始走在正確的路上。但是中午，當太陽在他們頭頂時，他們不知道哪裡是東哪裡是西，這就是為什麼他們在大田野中迷路的原因。然而，他們繼續走，晚上月亮出來了，照得很亮。於是他們躺在香甜的黃花中，除了稻草人和鐵皮樵夫，其他人都安然入睡直到早晨。</p>

    <p data-start="68.32" data-end="80.36">The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if they were quite sure which way they were going. "If we walk far enough," said Dorothy, "I am sure we shall sometime come to some place."</p>
    <p data-start="68.32" data-end="80.36">第二天早晨，太陽躲在雲後，但他們還是出發了，好像他們非常確定自己要去哪裡一樣。“如果我們走得夠遠，”桃樂絲說，“我相信我們總會到達某個地方。”</p>

    <p data-start="80.70" data-end="108.28">But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit. "We have surely lost our way," he said, "and unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains." "Nor I my heart," declared the Tin Woodman. "It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long journey."</p>
    <p data-start="80.70" data-end="108.28">但一天又一天過去了，他們面前仍然只看到紅色的田野。稻草人開始有點抱怨。“我們肯定迷路了，”他說，“除非我們及時找到回到翡翠城的路，否則我永遠得不到我的腦子。”“我也得不到我的心，”鐵皮樵夫宣稱。“在我看來，我幾乎無法等待到達奧茲，你必須承認這是一段非常長的旅程。”</p>

    <p data-start="108.76" data-end="138.58">"You see," said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, "I haven't the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all." Then Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.</p>
    <p data-start="108.76" data-end="138.58">“你看，”膽小獅子哽咽著說，“我沒有勇氣永遠跋涉，而什麼地方都沒到。”然後桃樂絲失去了信心。她坐在草地上看著她的同伴們，他們也坐下來看著她，托托發現這是他一生中第一次累得無法追逐飛過他頭頂的蝴蝶。於是他伸出舌頭，氣喘吁吁地看著桃樂絲，似乎在問他們接下來應該怎麼做。</p>

    <p data-start="138.60" data-end="167.58">"Suppose we call the field mice," she suggested. "They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City." "To be sure they could," cried the Scarecrow. "Why didn't we think of that before?" Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice: "What can I do for my friends?"</p>
    <p data-start="138.60" data-end="167.58">“我們叫田鼠來怎麼樣？”她建議道。“它們可能會告訴我們去翡翠城的路。”“當然可以，”稻草人喊道。“為什麼我們以前沒想到這個呢？”桃樂絲吹了吹她從老鼠女王那裡得到的掛在脖子上的小哨子。幾分鐘後，他們聽到小腳的噠噠聲，許多小灰鼠跑向她。其中包括女王本人，她用尖細的聲音問：“我能為我的朋友們做些什麼？”</p>

    <p data-start="170.86" data-end="181.46">"We have lost our way," said Dorothy. "Can you tell us where the Emerald City is?" "Certainly," answered the Queen;</p>
    <p data-start="170.86" data-end="181.46">“我們迷路了，”桃樂絲說。“你能告訴我們翡翠城在哪裡嗎？”“當然可以，”女王回答道；</p>

    <p data-start="181.46" data-end="202.42">"but it is a great way off, for you have had it at your backs all this time." Then she noticed Dorothy's Golden Cap, and said, "Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour." "I didn't know there was a charm," answered Dorothy, in surprise. "What is it?"</p>
    <p data-start="181.46" data-end="202.42">“但是它離這裡很遠，因為你們一直背對著它。”然後她注意到了桃樂絲的金帽子，說：“為什麼不使用帽子的魔力，召喚有翅膀的猴子呢？他們會在不到一小時內把你送到奧茲城。”“我不知道這有魔力，”桃樂絲驚訝地回答。“是什麼？”</p>

    <p data-start="202.96" data-end="215.82">"It is written inside the Golden Cap," replied the Queen of the Mice. "But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us."</p>
    <p data-start="202.96" data-end="215.82">“它寫在金帽子的內側，”老鼠女王回答說。“但是如果你要召喚有翅膀的猴子，我們必須逃跑，因為他們非常淘氣，認為折磨我們是很大的樂趣。”</p>

    <p data-start="216.38" data-end="223.52">"Won't they hurt me?" asked the girl anxiously. "Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!"</p>
    <p data-start="216.38" data-end="223.52">“他們不會傷害我嗎？”女孩焦急地問道。“哦，不會的。他們必須服從帽子的佩戴者。再見！”</p>

    <p data-start="224.08" data-end="241.40">And she scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her. Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.</p>
    <p data-start="224.08" data-end="241.40">她消失在視線之外，所有的老鼠都匆忙跟在她後面。桃樂絲看了看金帽子的內部，看到裡面寫了一些字。她想，這些一定是魔咒，所以她仔細閱讀了說明，然後把帽子戴在頭上。</p>

    <p data-start="242.10" data-end="250.36">"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing on her left foot. "What did you say?" asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was doing.</p>
    <p data-start="242.10" data-end="250.36">“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”她說，站在她的左腳上。“你說了什麼？”稻草人問道，他不知道她在做什麼。</p>

    <p data-start="251.10" data-end="259.34">"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went on, standing this time on her right foot. "Hello!" replied the Tin Woodman calmly.</p>
    <p data-start="251.10" data-end="259.34">“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”桃樂絲繼續說，這次站在她的右腳上。“你好！”鐵皮人冷靜地回答。</p>

    <p data-start="260.18" data-end="273.84">"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.</p>
    <p data-start="260.18" data-end="273.84">“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”桃樂絲說，這時她雙腳站立。這結束了咒語的念誦，他們聽到一陣嘰嘰喳喳和翅膀拍打的聲音，一群有翅膀的猴子飛向他們。</p>

    <p data-start="274.30" data-end="283.28">The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, "What is your command?" "We wish to go to the Emerald City," said the child, "and we have lost our way."</p>
    <p data-start="274.30" data-end="283.28">國王向桃樂絲深深鞠躬，問道：“你的命令是什麼？”“我們想去翡翠城，”孩子說，“我們迷路了。”</p>

    <p data-start="283.78" data-end="313.42">"We will carry you," replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her. Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;</p>
    <p data-start="283.78" data-end="313.42">“我們會帶你去，”國王回答道，他剛說完，兩隻猴子就抱住桃樂絲，帶著她飛走了。其他猴子則帶著稻草人、鐵皮人和獅子，一隻小猴子抓住托托跟在他們後面，儘管這隻狗努力想咬他。稻草人和鐵皮人起初相當害怕，因為他們記得有翅膀的猴子以前對他們很不好；</p>

    <p data-start="313.60" data-end="343.12">but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them. Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her. "Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?" she asked. "That is a long story," answered the King, with a Winged laugh;</p>
    <p data-start="313.60" data-end="343.12">但他們看到並無惡意，所以他們愉快地在空中飛行，欣賞著遠處美麗的花園和森林。桃樂絲發現自己輕鬆地坐在兩隻最大的猴子之間，其中一隻是國王本人。他們用手做了一把椅子，小心翼翼地不傷害她。“為什麼你必須服從金帽的咒語？”她問。“那是一個很長的故事，”國王帶著翅膀笑著回答；</p>

    <p data-start="343.52" data-end="385.42">"but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish." "I shall be glad to hear it," she replied. "Once," began the leader, "we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day.</p>
    <p data-start="343.52" data-end="385.42">「但由於我們有一段長途旅行，我會講講這個故事來打發時間，如果你願意的話。」她回答：「我很高興聽到這個故事。」領袖開始說：「從前，我們是一個自由的民族，快樂地生活在大森林裡，從樹到樹飛翔，吃堅果和水果，隨心所欲地做事，不需叫任何人為主人。也許有時我們有點太頑皮了，飛下來拉那些沒有翅膀的動物的尾巴，追趕鳥類，並向在森林裡行走的人們扔堅果。但是我們無憂無慮，充滿了快樂，享受每一天的每一分鐘。</p>

    <p data-start="385.86" data-end="398.24">This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land. "There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress.</p>
    <p data-start="385.86" data-end="398.24">這是很多年前的事了，早在奧茲從雲中出現來統治這片土地之前。「那時，在北方住著一位美麗的公主，她也是一位強大的女巫。</p>

    <p data-start="399.28" data-end="404.84">All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good.</p>
    <p data-start="399.28" data-end="404.84">她所有的魔法都是用來幫助人們的，從未有人知道她傷害過任何好人。</p>

    <p data-start="405.50" data-end="411.80">Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby.</p>
    <p data-start="405.50" data-end="411.80">她叫蓋麗特，住在一座由巨大紅寶石塊建成的漂亮宮殿裡。</p>

    <p data-start="412.40" data-end="425.14">Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise.</p>
    <p data-start="412.40" data-end="425.14">每個人都愛她，但她最大的悲哀是找不到一個人來愛她，因為所有的男人都太愚蠢和醜陋，無法與這麼美麗和智慧的人相配。</p>

    <p data-start="426.44" data-end="449.96">At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish.</p>
    <p data-start="426.44" data-end="449.96">然而，最終她找到了一個英俊、剛強且智慧超齡的男孩。蓋麗特決定當他長大成人時，她會讓他成為她的丈夫，所以她把他帶到她的紅寶石宮殿，並用她所有的魔法力量使他變得強壯、善良和可愛，如同任何女人所期望的一樣。</p>

    <p data-start="450.84" data-end="464.64">When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.</p>
    <p data-start="450.84" data-end="464.64">當他長大成人後，被稱為奎拉拉的他被認為是全國最優秀和最聰明的人，而他的英俊之美使蓋麗特深愛著他，急忙準備好一切以迎接婚禮。</p>

    <p data-start="464.88" data-end="505.90">"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.</p>
    <p data-start="464.88" data-end="505.90">「我祖父當時是住在蓋麗特宮殿附近森林中的飛猴之王，這位老傢伙比美餐更喜歡開玩笑。有一天，就在婚禮前不久，我祖父和他的隊伍飛出時，看見奎拉拉在河邊行走。他穿著粉色絲綢和紫色天鵝絨的華麗服裝，我祖父想看看他能做什麼。按照他的指示，隊伍飛下來抓住奎拉拉，把他抱在懷裡，直到他們在河中央，然後把他丟進水裡。</p>

    <p data-start="506.04" data-end="532.24">"`Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, `and see if the water has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore. But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river.</p>
    <p data-start="506.04" data-end="532.24">「‘游出來，我的好夥伴，’我祖父喊道，‘看看水是否弄髒了你的衣服。’奎拉拉非常聰明，當然會游泳，他並沒有被所有的好運氣寵壞。他笑了，當他浮出水面時，游到了岸邊。但當蓋麗特跑到他身邊時，她發現他的絲綢和天鵝絨都被河水弄壞了。</p>

    <p data-start="533.06" data-end="590.48">"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be."</p>
    <p data-start="533.06" data-end="590.48">「公主很生氣，她當然知道是誰做的。她把所有的飛猴都帶到她面前，起初她說他們的翅膀應該被綁起來，並且應該像他們對待奎拉拉那樣被丟進河裡。但是我祖父苦苦哀求，因為他知道飛猴們的翅膀被綁起來後會在河裡淹死，奎拉拉也為他們說了好話；因此蓋麗特最終饒恕了他們，條件是飛猴們從此以後要聽從金帽擁有者的三次命令。這頂帽子是為奎拉拉的婚禮禮物製作的，據說花費了公主半個王國。當然，我祖父和所有其他的飛猴立刻同意了這個條件，這就是為什麼我們成為金帽擁有者三次奴隸的原因，無論他是誰。」</p>

    <p data-start="590.64" data-end="597.04">"And what became of them?" asked Dorothy, who had been greatly interested in the story.</p>
    <p data-start="590.64" data-end="597.04">「他們怎麼樣了？」桃樂絲問道，她對這個故事非常感興趣。</p>

    <p data-start="598.14" data-end="640.44">"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap," replied the Monkey, "he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her. "This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us."</p>
    <p data-start="598.14" data-end="640.44">「奎拉拉是金帽的第一任擁有者，」猴子回答，「他是第一個對我們提出願望的人。由於他的新娘無法忍受看見我們，他在娶她後把我們全部召集到森林中，命令我們永遠保持在她再也看不到飛猴的地方，我們很樂意這麼做，因為我們都害怕她。「直到金帽落入西方邪惡女巫手中，她讓我們奴役溫基人，之後趕走了奧茲本人，這是我們唯一需要做的事。現在金帽是你的了，你有三次權利對我們提出願望。」</p>

    <p data-start="640.94" data-end="670.26">As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band. "That was a good ride," said the little girl.</p>
    <p data-start="640.94" data-end="670.26">當猴王講完他的故事時，桃樂絲低頭看見了他們面前綠色閃閃發光的翡翠城牆。她對飛猴的快速飛行感到驚訝，但對旅程結束感到高興。這些奇怪的生物小心地將旅行者們放在城門前，國王向桃樂絲深深鞠躬，然後迅速飛走了，所有的隊伍都跟著他。「這是一段愉快的旅程。」小女孩說。</p>

    <p data-start="670.28" data-end="679.14">"Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles," replied the Lion. "How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!"</p>
    <p data-start="670.28" data-end="679.14">「是的，這是擺脫我們困境的快速方法，」獅子回答。「真幸運你帶走了那頂奇妙的帽子！」</p>
