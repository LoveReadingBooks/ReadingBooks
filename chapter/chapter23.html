    <p data-start="16.84" data-end="19.84" style="margin-left: 35%;">Chapter 23: Glinda the Good Witch Grants Dorothy's Wish</p>
    <p data-start="16.84" data-end="19.84" style="margin-left: 35%;">第23章：好女巫葛林達實現了桃樂絲的願望</p>
    <p data-start="21.98" data-end="38.62">Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of the Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the Lion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints.</p>
    <p data-start="21.98" data-end="38.62">然而，在他們見葛林達之前，他們被帶到城堡的一個房間，讓桃樂絲洗臉梳頭，獅子把鬃毛上的灰塵抖掉，稻草人拍打自己使他保持最佳狀態，鐵皮人擦亮自己的錫皮並給關節上油。</p>
    <p data-start="40.02" data-end="64.80">When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies. She was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl.</p>
    <p data-start="40.02" data-end="64.80">當他們都收拾妥當後，他們跟隨士兵女孩來到一個大房間，葛林達女巫坐在紅寶石寶座上。在他們眼中，她既美麗又年輕。她的頭髮是豐富的紅色，鬈曲的頭髮垂在肩上。她的衣服是純白色的，但她的眼睛是藍色的，並慈愛地看著小女孩。</p>
    <p data-start="66.22" data-end="81.32">"What can I do for you, my child?" she asked. Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with.</p>
    <p data-start="66.22" data-end="81.32">“我能為你做什麼，我的孩子？”她問道。桃樂絲向女巫講述了她的全部故事：旋風如何把她帶到奧茲國，她如何找到她的同伴，以及他們經歷的奇妙冒險。</p>
    <p data-start="82.10" data-end="98.10">"My greatest wish now," she added, "is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it."</p>
    <p data-start="82.10" data-end="98.10">“我現在最大的願望，”她補充道，“就是回到堪薩斯，因為艾姆嬸嬸一定會認為我出了什麼可怕的事情，這會讓她穿上黑紗服；而且如果今年的作物比去年還差，我肯定亨利叔叔負擔不起。”</p>
    <p data-start="99.26" data-end="104.88">Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl.</p>
    <p data-start="99.26" data-end="104.88">葛林達前傾身體，吻了吻這個可愛小女孩仰起的臉。</p>
    <p data-start="106.24" data-end="114.88">"Bless your dear heart," she said, "I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas." Then she added,</p>
    <p data-start="106.24" data-end="114.88">“祝福你，親愛的，”她說，“我相信我能告訴你一種回到堪薩斯的方法。”然後她補充道：</p>
    <p data-start="115.92" data-end="126.44">"But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap." "Willingly!" exclaimed Dorothy; "indeed, it is of no use to me now,</p>
    <p data-start="115.92" data-end="126.44">“但是，如果我告訴你，你必須把金帽子給我。”“願意！”桃樂絲喊道；“事實上，現在它對我毫無用處，</p>
    <p data-start="127.16" data-end="156.38">and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times." "And I think I shall need their service just those three times," answered Glinda, smiling. Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow, "What will you do when Dorothy has left us?" "I will return to the Emerald City," he replied, "for Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads."</p>
    <p data-start="127.16" data-end="156.38">當你擁有它時，你可以命令飛猴三次。”“我想我正好需要它們三次服務，”葛林達微笑著回答。桃樂絲然後把金帽子給了她，女巫對稻草人說：“當桃樂絲離開我們時，你會怎麼做？”“我會回到翡翠城，”他回答說，“因為奧茲讓我成為它的統治者，人民喜歡我。我唯一擔心的是如何越過敲頭族的山丘。”</p>
    <p data-start="156.46" data-end="170.46">"By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City," said Glinda, "for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler."</p>
    <p data-start="156.46" data-end="170.46">“通過金帽子，我將命令飛猴把你送到翡翠城的門口，”葛林達說，“因為剝奪人民這樣一個出色的統治者是可恥的。”</p>
    <p data-start="170.46" data-end="179.48">"Am I really wonderful?" asked the Scarecrow. "You are unusual," replied Glinda.</p>
    <p data-start="170.46" data-end="179.48">“我真的很出色嗎？”稻草人問道。“你與眾不同，”葛林達回答。</p>
    <p data-start="180.32" data-end="185.72">Turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, "What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country?"</p>
    <p data-start="180.32" data-end="185.72">轉向鐵皮人，她問道：“當桃樂絲離開這個國家時，你會怎樣？”</p>
    <p data-start="186.78" data-end="205.42">He leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, "The Winkies were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever."</p>
    <p data-start="186.78" data-end="205.42">他靠在他的斧頭上，想了一會兒。然後他說：“雲奇人對我非常友善，當邪惡女巫死後，他們想讓我統治他們。我喜歡雲奇人，如果我能再次回到西國，我會非常樂意永遠統治他們。”</p>
    <p data-start="206.66" data-end="234.30">"My second command to the Winged Monkeys," said Glinda "will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter than he is--when you are well polished-- and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well." Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked,</p>
    <p data-start="206.66" data-end="234.30">“我對飛猴的第二個命令，”葛林達說，“是讓它們安全地把你帶到雲奇人的土地。你的大腦看起來可能沒有稻草人的大，但當你被擦亮時，你確實比他更聰明——我相信你會明智地統治雲奇人。”然後女巫看著那隻大而毛茸茸的獅子問道，</p>
    <p data-start="235.12" data-end="243.00">"When Dorothy has returned to her own home, what will become of you?" "Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads," he answered,</p>
    <p data-start="235.12" data-end="243.00">“當桃樂絲回到她的家鄉後，你會怎樣？”“在敲頭族的山丘那邊，”他回答，</p>
    <p data-start="243.74" data-end="256.20">"lies a grand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily there."</p>
    <p data-start="243.74" data-end="256.20">“有一片古老的森林，所有住在那裡的野獸都讓我成為他們的國王。如果我能回到這片森林，我會非常快樂地在那裡度過我的一生。”</p>
    <p data-start="257.56" data-end="292.04">"My third command to the Winged Monkeys," said Glinda, "shall be to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore." The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed: "You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas."</p>
    <p data-start="257.56" data-end="292.04">“我對飛猴的第三個命令，”葛林達說，“是讓它們把你帶到你的森林。然後，用完金帽子的力量後，我會把它給猴王，讓他和他的族群從此自由。”稻草人、鐵皮人和獅子現在真誠地感謝好女巫的善意；而桃樂絲驚呼：“你真的是既善良又美麗！但你還沒有告訴我如何回到堪薩斯。”</p>
    <p data-start="293.50" data-end="305.02">"Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert," replied Glinda. "If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country."</p>
    <p data-start="293.50" data-end="305.02">“你的銀鞋會帶你越過沙漠，”葛林達回答。“如果你早知道它們的力量，你在來到這個國家的第一天就可以回到艾姆嬸嬸身邊。”</p>
    <p data-start="306.34" data-end="319.56">"But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!" cried the Scarecrow. "I might have passed my whole life in the farmer's cornfield." "And I should not have had my lovely heart," said the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="306.34" data-end="319.56">“但那樣我就不會有我奇妙的大腦了！”稻草人喊道。“我可能會在農夫的玉米地裡度過我的一生。”“而我就不會有我可愛的心了，”鐵皮人說。</p>
    <p data-start="320.14" data-end="347.72">"I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world." "And I should have lived a coward forever," declared the Lion, "and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me." "This is all true," said Dorothy, "and I am glad I was of use to these good friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired, and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should like to go back to Kansas."</p>
    <p data-start="320.14" data-end="347.72">“我可能會一直在森林裡生鏽直到世界末日。”“而我就會永遠是一個懦夫，”獅子說，“森林裡的野獸也不會有一句好話說我。”“這些都是真的，”桃樂絲說，“我很高興我對這些好朋友有所幫助。但現在他們每個人都得到了他們最想要的東西，每個人都有一個王國來統治，我想我應該回到堪薩斯。”</p>
    <p data-start="348.72" data-end="377.24">"The Silver Shoes," said the Good Witch, "have wonderful powers. And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go."</p>
    <p data-start="348.72" data-end="377.24">“銀鞋，”好女巫說，“有奇妙的力量。其中最奇妙的一點是，它們能在三步之內把你帶到世界上的任何地方，而且每一步都在眨眼之間完成。你所要做的就是把鞋跟敲擊三下，命令鞋子把你帶到任何你想去的地方。”</p>
    <p data-start="378.26" data-end="399.36">"If that is so," said the child joyfully, "I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once." She threw her arms around the Lion's neck and kissed him, patting his big head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints.</p>
    <p data-start="378.26" data-end="399.36">“如果真是這樣，”孩子高興地說，“我會立刻讓它們帶我回到堪薩斯。”她伸出雙臂抱住獅子的脖子，親吻了他，溫柔地拍著他的頭。然後她吻了鐵皮人，他哭得對他的關節來說非常危險。</p>
    <p data-start="400.26" data-end="412.20">But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face, and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades.</p>
    <p data-start="400.26" data-end="412.20">但她用胳膊擁抱了稻草人柔軟的身體，而不是親吻他的畫臉，發現自己在與愛她的同伴悲傷告別時也在哭泣。</p>
    <p data-start="413.40" data-end="424.82">Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself.</p>
    <p data-start="413.40" data-end="424.82">好女巫葛林達從她的紅寶石寶座上下來，給了小女孩一個告別吻，桃樂絲感謝她對她的朋友和自己所表現的所有善意。</p>
    <p data-start="425.62" data-end="450.40">Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying: "Take me home to Aunt Em!" Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.</p>
    <p data-start="425.62" data-end="450.40">桃樂絲現在莊重地把托托抱在懷裡，並在說了最後一聲再見後，她把鞋跟敲擊了三下，說：“帶我回到艾姆嬸嬸身邊！”立刻，她在空中旋轉起來，迅速得她只能感覺到耳邊呼嘯的風。</p>
    <p data-start="450.42" data-end="464.40">The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was. At length, however, she sat up and looked about her.</p>
    <p data-start="450.42" data-end="464.40">銀鞋只走了三步，然後她突然停了下來，滾了好幾圈才知道自己在哪裡。終於，她坐起來，四處張望。</p>
    <p data-start="464.40" data-end="478.96">"Good gracious!" she cried. For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one.</p>
    <p data-start="464.40" data-end="478.96">“天哪！”她喊道。因為她正坐在寬闊的堪薩斯大草原上，而她面前就是亨利叔叔在旋風把舊房子捲走後建的新農舍。</p>
    <p data-start="479.90" data-end="492.42">Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously. Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet.</p>
    <p data-start="479.90" data-end="492.42">亨利叔叔正在牛棚裡擠奶，托托已經從她懷裡跳出來，向牛棚跑去，狂吠不止。桃樂絲站起來，發現自己穿著襪子。</p>
    <p data-start="493.12" data-end="499.24">For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert.</p>
    <p data-start="493.12" data-end="499.24">因為銀鞋在她的飛行中掉了下來，永遠丟在沙漠中了。</p>
