    <p data-start="14.04" data-end="16.20" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十五章：奧茲的真面目</p>
  
    <p data-start="18.36" data-end="22.30">The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell.</p>
    <p data-start="18.36" data-end="22.30">四個旅行者走到翡翠城的大門前並按了門鈴。</p>
  
    <p data-start="22.86" data-end="28.36">After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before.</p>
    <p data-start="22.86" data-end="28.36">按了幾次門鈴後，之前見過的那位守門人打開了門。</p>
  
    <p data-start="29.48" data-end="32.96">"What! are you back again?" he asked, in surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="29.48" data-end="32.96">「什麼！你們又回來了？」他驚訝地問道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="34.00" data-end="39.72">"Do you not see us?" answered the Scarecrow. "But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West."</p>
    <p data-start="34.00" data-end="39.72">「你沒看見我們嗎？」稻草人回答道。「但我以為你們已經去拜訪西方邪惡女巫了。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="40.48" data-end="42.82">"We did visit her," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="40.48" data-end="42.82">「我們確實拜訪了她。」稻草人說道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="43.20" data-end="51.02">"And she let you go again?" asked the man, in wonder. "She could not help it, for she is melted," explained the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="43.20" data-end="51.02">「她又讓你們走了？」那人驚訝地問。「她沒辦法，因為她已經融化了。」稻草人解釋道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="51.64" data-end="56.76">"Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed," said the man. "Who melted her?"</p>
    <p data-start="51.64" data-end="56.76">「融化了！這確實是個好消息。」那人說。「誰融化了她？」</p>
  
    <p data-start="57.48" data-end="84.46">"It was Dorothy," said the Lion gravely. "Good gracious!" exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before her. Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.</p>
    <p data-start="57.48" data-end="84.46">「是桃樂絲。」獅子嚴肅地說。「天哪！」那人驚呼，並向她深深鞠了一躬。然後他帶他們進入他的小房間，像之前一樣從大盒子裡拿出眼鏡給他們戴上。之後他們通過大門進入翡翠城。當人們從守門人那裡聽說桃樂絲融化了西方邪惡女巫時，他們都聚集在旅行者周圍，並成群結隊地跟隨他們到奧茲的宮殿。</p>
  
    <p data-start="84.66" data-end="114.46">The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.</p>
    <p data-start="84.66" data-end="114.46">那個留著綠鬍子的士兵仍然在門前守衛，但他立刻讓他們進去了，他們再次見到了那個美麗的綠衣女孩，她立即帶他們到以前的房間休息，直到偉大的奧茲準備接見他們。</p>
  
    <p data-start="114.76" data-end="143.38">The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery.</p>
    <p data-start="114.76" data-end="143.38">士兵將消息立即傳達給奧茲，說桃樂絲和其他旅行者在消滅邪惡女巫後又回來了；但奧茲沒有回應。他們以為偉大的巫師會立即召見他們，但並沒有。他們第二天沒有收到他的消息，接下來的幾天也沒有。等待變得枯燥乏味，最終他們對奧茲的待遇感到惱火，因為他讓他們去承受艱難和奴役。</p>
  
    <p data-start="144.10" data-end="173.98">So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not. When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o'clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.</p>
    <p data-start="144.10" data-end="173.98">於是稻草人最後請綠衣女孩帶另一個訊息給奧茲，說如果他不立即讓他們進去見他，他們將召喚有翼猴子來幫助他們，看看他是否履行了他的承諾。當巫師收到這個訊息時，他非常害怕，立即通知他們第二天早上九點零四分來見他。他曾在西方之地遇到過有翼猴子，不希望再次遇到它們。</p>
  
    <p data-start="174.00" data-end="203.74">The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again. Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.</p>
    <p data-start="174.00" data-end="203.74">四位旅行者度過了一個不眠之夜，每個人都在想奧茲答應給他的禮物。桃樂絲只睡了一次，然後她夢見自己在堪薩斯，艾姆嬸嬸告訴她有多高興她的小女孩回家了。第二天早上九點，留著綠鬍子的士兵準時來到他們那裡，四分鐘後，他們全都進入了偉大奧茲的寶座廳。</p>
  
    <p data-start="203.76" data-end="229.26">Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.</p>
    <p data-start="203.76" data-end="229.26">當然，他們每個人都期待看到巫師以他之前的形態出現，當他們四處張望卻發現房間裡根本沒有人時，都大吃一驚。他們靠近門口，緊緊靠在一起，因為空房間的靜謐比他們見過的奧茲的任何形態都更加可怕。</p>
  
    <p data-start="230.00" data-end="237.26">Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it said:</p>
    <p data-start="230.00" data-end="237.26">不久，他們聽到一個莊嚴的聲音，似乎來自大圓頂的頂部附近，聲音說：</p>
  
    <p data-start="237.84" data-end="248.78">"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?" They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothy asked, "Where are you?"</p>
    <p data-start="237.84" data-end="248.78">「我是奧茲，偉大而可怕的奧茲。你們為什麼找我？」他們再次查看房間的每個角落，然後，見沒有人，桃樂絲問：「你在哪裡？」</p>
  
    <p data-start="249.24" data-end="281.46">"I am everywhere," answered the Voice, "but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me." Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said: "We have come to claim our promise, O Oz." "What promise?" asked Oz. "You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed," said the girl.</p>
    <p data-start="249.24" data-end="281.46">「我無處不在。」聲音回答道，「但在普通人的眼中我是隱形的。我現在會坐上寶座，你們可以和我對話。」事實上，聲音似乎剛剛確實是從寶座那裡傳來的；於是他們走向寶座，排成一排站著，桃樂絲說：「我們來是要兌現承諾，奧茲。」奧茲問：「什麼承諾？」女孩說：「你答應過當邪惡女巫被消滅後送我回堪薩斯。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="281.52" data-end="287.76">"And you promised to give me brains," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="281.52" data-end="287.76">「你還答應給我智慧。」稻草人說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="287.78" data-end="293.66">"And you promised to give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman. "And you promised to give me courage," said the Cowardly Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="287.78" data-end="293.66">「你還答應給我一顆心。」鐵皮人說。「你還答應給我勇氣。」膽小的獅子說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="294.06" data-end="300.68">"Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?" asked the Voice, and Dorothy thought it trembled a little.</p>
    <p data-start="294.06" data-end="300.68">「邪惡女巫真的被消滅了嗎？」聲音問道，桃樂絲覺得聲音有些顫抖。</p>
  
    <p data-start="300.80" data-end="307.62">"Yes," she answered, "I melted her with a bucket of water." "Dear me," said the Voice,</p>
    <p data-start="300.80" data-end="307.62">「是的。」她回答，「我用一桶水把她融化了。」聲音說：「天啊，」</p>
  
    <p data-start="308.08" data-end="344.38">"how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for I must have time to think it over." "You've had plenty of time already," said the Tin Woodman angrily. "We shan't wait a day longer," said the Scarecrow. "You must keep your promises to us!" exclaimed Dorothy. The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner.</p>
    <p data-start="308.08" data-end="344.38">「真突然！那麼，明天來找我吧，我需要時間考慮。」鐵皮人憤怒地說：「你已經有足夠的時間了。」稻草人說：「我們不會再等一天了。」桃樂絲大聲說：「你必須兌現對我們的承諾！」獅子認為嚇唬巫師可能也不錯，所以他發出一聲巨大的吼叫，聲音如此猛烈和可怕，以至於托托嚇得跳開，撞翻了角落裡的屏風。</p>
  
    <p data-start="344.92" data-end="386.50">As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were. The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and cried out, "Who are you?" "I am Oz, the Great and Terrible," said the little man, in a trembling voice. "But don't strike me--please don't--and I'll do anything you want me to." Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay. "I thought Oz was a great Head," said Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="344.92" data-end="386.50">當屏風摔下來時，他們朝那邊看去，下一刻，他們都充滿了驚奇。因為他們看到，就在屏風遮擋的位置，站著一個小老頭，光頭皺臉，看起來和他們一樣驚訝。鐵皮人舉起斧頭，衝向小老頭，喊道：「你是誰？」小老頭顫抖著聲音說：「我是奧茲，偉大而可怕的奧茲。但是不要打我——請不要——我會做任何你們想讓我做的事。」我們的朋友們驚訝和沮喪地看著他。「我以為奧茲是一個大頭，」桃樂絲說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="387.02" data-end="397.58">"And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady," said the Scarecrow. "And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast," said the Tin Woodman. "And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire," exclaimed the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="387.02" data-end="397.58">「我以為奧茲是一位美麗的女士，」稻草人說。「我以為奧茲是一個可怕的野獸，」鐵皮人說。「我以為奧茲是一團火球，」獅子驚叫道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="398.46" data-end="405.96">"No, you are all wrong," said the little man meekly. "I have been making believe."</p>
    <p data-start="398.46" data-end="405.96">「不，你們都錯了，」小老頭溫順地說。「我一直在假裝。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="406.12" data-end="425.08">"Making believe!" cried Dorothy. "Are you not a Great Wizard?" "Hush, my dear," he said. "Don't speak so loud, or you will be overheard--and I should be ruined. I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard." "And aren't you?" she asked. "Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man."</p>
    <p data-start="406.12" data-end="425.08">「假裝！」桃樂絲喊道。「你不是一位大巫師嗎？」他說：「小聲點，我親愛的。不要說那麼大聲，否則會被人聽見的——我就完蛋了。我應該是一位大巫師。」她問：「你不是嗎？」他回答：「一點也不是，我親愛的；我只是一個普通人。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="425.84" data-end="431.50">"You're more than that," said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; "you're a humbug."</p>
    <p data-start="425.84" data-end="431.50">「你不只是普通人，」稻草人用悲傷的語氣說。「你是個騙子。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="432.42" data-end="443.78">"Exactly so!" declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him. "I am a humbug." "But this is terrible," said the Tin Woodman. "How shall I ever get my heart?"</p>
    <p data-start="432.42" data-end="443.78">小老頭說：「正是如此！」他一邊說，一邊搓著手，彷彿這讓他很高興。「我是個騙子。」鐵皮人說：「這太糟糕了。我怎麼才能得到我的心呢？」</p>
  
    <p data-start="444.34" data-end="452.16">"Or I my courage?" asked the Lion. "Or I my brains?" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve.</p>
    <p data-start="444.34" data-end="452.16">「那我怎麼得到我的勇氣呢？」獅子問道。「那我怎麼得到我的腦子呢？」稻草人哭喊著，用外套袖子擦去眼淚。</p>
  
    <p data-start="453.30" data-end="462.32">"My dear friends," said Oz, "I pray you not to speak of these little things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found out."</p>
    <p data-start="453.30" data-end="462.32">奧茲說：「親愛的朋友們，我請你們不要談論這些小事。想想我吧，被發現的困境是多麼可怕。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="463.26" data-end="471.88">"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?" asked Dorothy. "No one knows it but you four--and myself," replied Oz.</p>
    <p data-start="463.26" data-end="471.88">桃樂絲問：「沒有人知道你是個騙子嗎？」奧茲回答：「除了你們四個和我自己，沒有人知道。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="472.54" data-end="510.10">"I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible." "But, I don't understand," said Dorothy, in bewilderment. "How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?" "That was one of my tricks," answered Oz. "Step this way, please, and I will tell you all about it." He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face.</p>
    <p data-start="472.54" data-end="510.10">「我騙了所有人這麼久，以至於我以為我永遠不會被發現。讓你們進入王座室是我犯的重大錯誤。通常我甚至不會見我的臣民，所以他們相信我是可怕的。」桃樂絲困惑地說：「但是，我不明白，為什麼你對我顯現為一個大頭？」奧茲回答：「那是我的一個把戲。請這邊走，我會告訴你們一切。」他帶路走到王座室後面的一个小房間，所有人跟著他。他指著一個角落，那裡放著一個大頭，由多層紙製成，臉被仔細地畫上顏色。</p>
  
    <p data-start="510.26" data-end="526.68">"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire," said Oz. "I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open." "But how about the voice?" she inquired.</p>
    <p data-start="510.26" data-end="526.68">奧茲說：「這個我用一根線掛在天花板上。我站在屏風後面拉線，使眼睛移動和嘴巴張開。」她問道：「那聲音是怎麼回事？」</p>
  
    <p data-start="527.40" data-end="538.52">"Oh, I am a ventriloquist," said the little man. "I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you."</p>
    <p data-start="527.40" data-end="538.52">小老頭說：「哦，我是一名腹語師。我可以把聲音投向任何地方，所以你們以為聲音是從大頭裡出來的。這裡是我用來欺騙你們的其他東西。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="539.08" data-end="553.66">He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out.</p>
    <p data-start="539.08" data-end="553.66">他展示給稻草人看他裝扮成漂亮女士時所穿的衣服和面具。而鐵皮人看到他的可怕野獸只不過是許多皮革縫在一起，並用板條支撐著。</p>
  
    <p data-start="554.28" data-end="565.04">As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.</p>
    <p data-start="554.28" data-end="565.04">至於火球，那位假巫師也把它掛在天花板上。它實際上是一個棉球，但當倒上油時，棉球燃燒得很猛烈。</p>
  
    <p data-start="565.82" data-end="595.80">"Really," said the Scarecrow, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug." "I am--I certainly am," answered the little man sorrowfully; "but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story." So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale. "I was born in Omaha--" "Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!" cried Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="565.82" data-end="595.80">稻草人說：「真的，你應該為自己是個騙子而感到羞愧。」小老頭悲傷地回答：「我確實是，我確實是，但這是我唯一能做的事。請坐下，有很多椅子；我會告訴你們我的故事。」所以他們坐下來，聽他講以下的故事。「我出生在奧馬哈——」「那不是離堪薩斯很近嗎！」桃樂絲喊道。</p>
  
    <p data-start="595.84" data-end="649.32">"No, but it's farther from here," he said, shaking his head at her sadly. "When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast." Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was. "After a time," continued Oz, "I tired of that, and became a balloonist." "What is that?" asked Dorothy. "A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus," he explained. "Oh," she said, "I know." "Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so that I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away.</p>
    <p data-start="595.84" data-end="649.32">「不，但離這裡更遠，」他悲傷地搖頭對她說。「我長大後成為一名腹語師，在這方面，我受過一位大師的精心訓練。我可以模仿任何種類的鳥或野獸。」說到這裡，他像小貓一樣喵喵叫，托托豎起耳朵四處張望，看看她在哪裡。奧茲繼續說：「過了一段時間，我厭倦了這種工作，成為一名氣球飛行員。」桃樂絲問：「那是什麼？」他解釋說：「在馬戲團表演日，一個人乘氣球升空，以吸引一群人聚集起來，讓他們付費觀看馬戲團。」她說：「哦，我知道了。」他接著說：「有一天，我乘氣球升空，繩子被扭結了，我無法下來。氣球飄到了雲層之上，很遠很遠，氣流把它帶到了許多許多英里外。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="649.40" data-end="679.12">For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country. "It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.</p>
    <p data-start="649.40" data-end="679.12">「我在空中旅行了一天一夜，在第二天早晨醒來時，發現氣球漂浮在一個陌生而美麗的國度上空。氣球逐漸降落，我一點也沒有受傷。但我發現自己處於一群奇怪的人中間，他們看到我從雲層中降落下來，認為我是個大巫師。當然，我讓他們這麼想，因為他們害怕我，並承諾會做任何我希望他們做的事。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="679.38" data-end="705.88">"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well. Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green."</p>
    <p data-start="679.38" data-end="705.88">「只是為了娛樂自己，讓這些好人忙起來，我命令他們建造這個城市和我的宮殿；他們都心甘情願地做得很好。然後我想，既然這個國家如此綠意盎然、美麗動人，我就把它叫做翡翠城；為了讓這個名字更貼切，我給所有人戴上綠色眼鏡，這樣他們看到的一切都是綠色的。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="706.10" data-end="743.56">"But isn't everything here green?" asked Dorothy. "No more than in any other city," replied Oz; "but when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy.</p>
    <p data-start="706.10" data-end="743.56">桃樂絲問：「但這裡的一切不是都是綠色的嗎？」奧茲回答：「不比其他任何城市更綠，但當你戴上綠色眼鏡時，當然你看到的一切都會顯得綠色。翡翠城是很多年前建造的，因為當氣球把我帶到這裡時，我還是個年輕人，而現在我已經很老了。但是我的人民戴綠色眼鏡的時間太久了，以至於他們中的大多數人認為這真的是一座翡翠城，這確實是一個美麗的地方，充滿了寶石和貴金屬，以及讓人幸福的所有美好事物。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="744.28" data-end="752.16">I have been good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them.</p>
    <p data-start="744.28" data-end="752.16">「我對人民很好，他們也喜歡我；但是自從這座宮殿建成後，我就把自己關起來，不見任何人。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="753.18" data-end="763.78">"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things.</p>
    <p data-start="753.18" data-end="763.78">「我最大的恐懼之一就是女巫，因為雖然我根本沒有任何魔法力量，但我很快發現女巫們確實能做出奇妙的事情。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="764.74" data-end="778.16">There were four of them in this country, and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West. Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm;</p>
    <p data-start="764.74" data-end="778.16">「這個國家有四個女巫，她們統治著住在北方、南方、東方和西方的人們。幸運的是，北方和南方的女巫是好的，我知道她們不會傷害我；」</p>
  
    <p data-start="778.80" data-end="812.70">but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East. When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises."</p>
    <p data-start="778.80" data-end="812.70">「但東方和西方的女巫非常邪惡，如果她們不認為我比她們自己更強大，她們肯定會毀滅我。事實上，這些年來我一直對她們充滿致命的恐懼；所以你可以想象，當我聽到你的房子壓死了東方的邪惡女巫時，我有多高興。當你來找我時，我願意承諾任何事情，只要你能解決另一個女巫；但是，現在你已經把她融化了，我很羞愧地說我不能履行我的承諾。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="814.36" data-end="827.04">"I think you are a very bad man," said Dorothy. "Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad Wizard, I must admit." "Can't you give me brains?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="814.36" data-end="827.04">桃樂絲說：「我認為你是個非常壞的人。」 「哦，不，我的親愛的；我實際上是一個非常好的人，但我必須承認，我是一個非常糟糕的巫師。」稻草人問道：「你不能給我大腦嗎？」</p>
  
    <p data-start="827.90" data-end="841.86">"You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has brains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get."</p>
    <p data-start="827.90" data-end="841.86">「你不需要它們。你每天都在學習一些東西。嬰兒有大腦，但它不懂很多。經驗是唯一能帶來知識的東西，而且你在地球上的時間越長，你肯定會獲得越多的經驗。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="842.10" data-end="847.90">"That may all be true," said the Scarecrow, "but I shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains."</p>
    <p data-start="842.10" data-end="847.90">「這些都可能是真的，」稻草人說，「但除非你給我大腦，否則我會很不開心。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="848.06" data-end="871.22">The false Wizard looked at him carefully. "Well," he said with a sigh, "I'm not much of a magician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head with brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find that out for yourself."</p>
    <p data-start="848.06" data-end="871.22">假巫師仔細地看了他一眼。「嗯，」他歎了口氣說，「正如我所說，我並不是什麼厲害的魔法師；但如果你明天早上來找我，我會把你的頭塞滿大腦。然而，我不能告訴你如何使用它們；你必須自己發現這一點。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="871.52" data-end="886.12">"Oh, thank you--thank you!" cried the Scarecrow. "I'll find a way to use them, never fear!" "But how about my courage?" asked the Lion anxiously. "You have plenty of courage, I am sure," answered Oz. "All you need is confidence in yourself.</p>
    <p data-start="871.52" data-end="886.12">「哦，謝謝你--謝謝你！」稻草人叫道。「我會找到使用它們的方法，別擔心！」 「但是我的勇氣怎麼辦？」獅子焦急地問。「我相信你有很多勇氣，」奧茲回答。「你所需要的只是對自己的信心。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="886.62" data-end="901.78">There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty." "Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same," said the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="886.62" data-end="901.78">「面對危險時，沒有任何生物不害怕。真正的勇氣是在你害怕時面對危險，而你擁有很多這樣的勇氣。」 「也許我有，但我還是很害怕，」獅子說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="902.64" data-end="909.46">"I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid."</p>
    <p data-start="902.64" data-end="909.46">「除非你給我那種讓人忘記害怕的勇氣，否則我真的會非常不開心。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="910.80" data-end="939.62">"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow," replied Oz. "How about my heart?" asked the Tin Woodman. "Why, as for that," answered Oz, "I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart." "That must be a matter of opinion," said the Tin Woodman. "For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me the heart."</p>
    <p data-start="910.80" data-end="939.62">「好的，我明天會給你那種勇氣，」奧茲回答。「那我的心呢？」鐵皮人問。「至於這個，」奧茲回答說，「我覺得你想要一顆心是錯的。它使大多數人不快樂。如果你知道的話，你沒心其實是幸運的。」 「那一定是見仁見智的問題，」鐵皮人說。「對我來說，如果你給我心，我會默默承受所有的不快樂。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="940.80" data-end="952.72">"Very well," answered Oz meekly. "Come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer."</p>
    <p data-start="940.80" data-end="952.72">「好的，」奧茲謙虛地回答。「明天來找我，你會有一顆心。我當了這麼多年的巫師，還不如再繼續扮演這個角色一段時間。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="954.00" data-end="967.40">"And now," said Dorothy, "how am I to get back to Kansas?" "We shall have to think about that," replied the little man. "Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to carry you over the desert.</p>
    <p data-start="954.00" data-end="967.40">「現在，」桃樂絲說，「我怎麼回堪薩斯？」 「我們必須考慮一下這個問題，」小個子回答。「給我兩三天時間考慮一下，我會想辦法帶你穿越沙漠。」</p>
  
    <p data-start="968.16" data-end="1003.54">In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in return for my help--such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug." They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to their rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that "The Great and Terrible Humbug," as she called him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.</p>
    <p data-start="968.16" data-end="1003.54">「同時，你們都會被當作我的客人對待，在你們住在宮殿裡的時候，我的人民會照顧你們，服從你們的任何願望。我唯一要求的回報就是——無論如何。你們必須保守我的秘密，不告訴任何人我是個騙子。」他們同意不說他們所知道的，並興高采烈地回到自己的房間。即使是桃樂絲也希望「偉大而可怕的騙子」，正如她稱呼他那樣，會找到一個方法把她送回堪薩斯，如果他做到了，她願意原諒他的一切。</p>
