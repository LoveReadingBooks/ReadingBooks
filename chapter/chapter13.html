    <p data-start="12.86" data-end="13.44" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十三章：拯救。</p>

    <p data-start="15.10" data-end="32.54">The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free. They went in together to the castle, where Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves.</p>
    <p data-start="15.10" data-end="32.54">膽小的獅子聽到邪惡的女巫被一桶水融化了，非常高興，桃樂絲立刻打開他的監獄門，將他釋放出來。他們一起進入城堡，桃樂絲的第一個行動就是召集所有的溫基人，告訴他們他們不再是奴隸了。</p>

    <p data-start="32.54" data-end="51.30">There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing.</p>
    <p data-start="32.54" data-end="51.30">黃皮膚的溫基人非常歡欣鼓舞，因為他們多年來一直被邪惡的女巫強迫辛苦工作，女巫總是殘酷地對待他們。他們將這一天定為節日，從此以後，每年都會在這一天慶祝和跳舞。</p>

    <p data-start="51.76" data-end="78.40">"If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us," said the Lion, "I should be quite happy." "Don't you suppose we could rescue them?" asked the girl anxiously. "We can try," answered the Lion. So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage.</p>
    <p data-start="51.76" data-end="78.40">“如果我們的朋友，稻草人和鐵皮樵夫，能和我們在一起，我會非常高興。”獅子說。“你不認為我們可以拯救他們嗎？”女孩焦急地問。“我們可以試試，”獅子回答。於是他們召集了黃皮膚的溫基人，問他們是否願意幫助救出他們的朋友，溫基人說他們非常樂意為桃樂絲做一切力所能及的事，因為她把他們從奴役中解救出來。</p>

    <p data-start="79.04" data-end="119.90">So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short. The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry. When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies: "Are any of your people tinsmiths?"</p>
    <p data-start="79.04" data-end="119.90">於是她選了一些看起來最有知識的溫基人，他們一起出發了。他們那天和第二天的一部分時間都在旅行，直到他們來到鐵皮樵夫躺著的岩石平原，他全身損壞彎曲。他的斧頭就在他附近，但刀片生鏽了，手柄也折斷了。溫基人溫柔地把他抱在懷裡，帶回了黃城堡，桃樂絲在路上為她老朋友的悲慘境遇流了幾滴眼淚，而獅子則看起來嚴肅而悲傷。當他們到達城堡時，桃樂絲對溫基人說：“你們中有誰是鐵匠嗎？”</p>

    <p data-start="120.70" data-end="126.50">"Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths," they told her. "Then bring them to me," she said.</p>
    <p data-start="120.70" data-end="126.50">“哦，是的。我們中有些人是非常好的鐵匠，”他們告訴她。“那就把他們帶到我這裡來，”她說。</p>

    <p data-start="127.10" data-end="140.50">And when the tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, "Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?"</p>
    <p data-start="127.10" data-end="140.50">當鐵匠們帶著所有工具來到時，她問道：“你們能把鐵皮樵夫的凹痕拉直，把他彎回原形，並把他斷裂的地方焊接起來嗎？”</p>

    <p data-start="141.40" data-end="182.72">The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.</p>
    <p data-start="141.40" data-end="182.72">鐵匠們仔細地檢查了鐵皮樵夫，然後回答說他們認為可以修好他，使他恢復如初。於是他們開始在城堡的一間大黃屋裡工作，連續三天四夜不停地敲打、扭曲、彎曲、焊接、拋光和敲擊鐵皮樵夫的腿、身體和頭部，直到最後他被拉直成原來的樣子，關節也像以前一樣靈活。當然，他身上有幾個補丁，但鐵匠們做得很好，而鐵皮樵夫並不是一個虛榮的人，所以他根本不介意這些補丁。</p>

    <p data-start="183.70" data-end="219.04">When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried.</p>
    <p data-start="183.70" data-end="219.04">當他最後走進桃樂絲的房間，感謝她拯救了他時，他高興得流下了淚水，桃樂絲不得不用圍裙小心地擦掉他臉上的每一滴淚水，這樣他的關節才不會生鏽。同時，她自己也因再次見到老朋友的喜悅而熱淚盈眶，這些淚水不需要擦掉。至於獅子，他用尾巴尖擦眼睛的次數太多，以至於尾巴變得濕漉漉的，他不得不走到院子裡，把尾巴放在陽光下曬乾。</p>

    <p data-start="219.46" data-end="230.76">"If we only had the Scarecrow with us again," said the Tin Woodman, when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, "I should be quite happy."</p>
    <p data-start="219.46" data-end="230.76">“如果我們能再次和稻草人在一起，”當桃樂絲告訴他發生的一切後，鐵皮樵夫說，“我會非常高興。”</p>

    <p data-start="231.62" data-end="275.12">"We must try to find him," said the girl. So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the scarecrow's clothes. It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it; but the Woodman said at once, "I'll chop it down, and then we can get the Scarecrow's clothes." Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old broken handle.</p>
    <p data-start="231.62" data-end="275.12">“我們必須試著找到他，”女孩說。於是她叫來溫基人幫助她，他們走了一整天和第二天的一部分時間，直到來到高樹下，樹枝上掛著有翼猴子扔的稻草人的衣服。這是一棵非常高的樹，樹幹非常光滑，沒有人能爬上去；但是樵夫馬上說：“我來砍倒它，然後我們就能拿到稻草人的衣服了。”當鐵匠們忙著修理樵夫的時候，另一位溫基人，他是一名金匠，已經用純金製作了一個斧柄，並將其安裝在樵夫的斧頭上，代替了舊的斷柄。</p>

    <p data-start="275.72" data-end="281.86">Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver.</p>
    <p data-start="275.72" data-end="281.86">其他人則拋光了刀片，直到所有的銹跡都被去除，刀片閃閃發光，像拋光的銀器一樣。</p>

    <p data-start="282.72" data-end="295.68">As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow's clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.</p>
    <p data-start="282.72" data-end="295.68">他一說完，鐵皮樵夫就開始砍樹，沒過多久，樹就轟然倒下，稻草人的衣服從樹枝上掉下來，滾落在地上。</p>

    <p data-start="296.42" data-end="312.06">Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him.</p>
    <p data-start="296.42" data-end="312.06">桃樂絲撿起衣服，讓溫基人把它們帶回城堡，然後用漂亮、乾淨的稻草填滿；瞧！稻草人又回到了從前的樣子，並一再感謝他們救了他。</p>

    <p data-start="312.32" data-end="320.88">Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable.</p>
    <p data-start="312.32" data-end="320.88">現在，他們重聚了，桃樂絲和她的朋友們在黃城堡度過了幾個快樂的日子，在那裡他們找到了所有需要的東西，使他們感到舒適。</p>

    <p data-start="321.96" data-end="345.46">But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, "We must go back to Oz, and claim his promise." "Yes," said the Woodman, "at last I shall get my heart." "And I shall get my brains," added the Scarecrow joyfully. "And I shall get my courage," said the Lion thoughtfully. "And I shall get back to Kansas," cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.</p>
    <p data-start="321.96" data-end="345.46">但有一天，女孩想起了艾姆嬸嬸，說道：“我們必須回到奧茲，實現他的承諾。”“是的，”樵夫說，“我終於能得到我的心了。”“我也將得到我的腦子，”稻草人快樂地補充道。“我將得到我的勇氣，”獅子深思地說。“而我將回到堪薩斯，”桃樂絲拍著手叫道。</p>

    <p data-start="346.20" data-end="365.92">"Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!" This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West.</p>
    <p data-start="346.20" data-end="365.92">“哦，讓我們明天出發去翡翠城吧！”他們決定這麼做。第二天，他們召集了溫基人，向他們道別。溫基人對他們的離開感到難過，他們已經非常喜歡鐵皮樵夫，請求他留下來統治他們和西方的黃土地。</p>

    <p data-start="367.04" data-end="391.14">Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.</p>
    <p data-start="367.04" data-end="391.14">發現他們決心要走，溫基人給托托和獅子各一個金項圈；並給桃樂絲一個鑲有鑽石的美麗手鐲；給稻草人一根金頭手杖，以防他絆倒；給鐵皮樵夫一個鑲嵌著金子和寶石的銀油壺。</p>

    <p data-start="392.02" data-end="420.36">Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and all shook hands with them until their arms ached. Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.</p>
    <p data-start="392.02" data-end="420.36">每個旅行者都給溫基人做了一個漂亮的演講作為回報，並與他們握手，直到手臂酸痛。桃樂絲走到女巫的櫥櫃裡，裝滿了旅行用的食物，看到了一頂金色帽子。她試戴了一下，發現非常合適。她不知道金色帽子的魔力，但她覺得它很漂亮，所以她決定戴上它，把遮陽帽放在籃子裡。</p>

    <p data-start="420.90" data-end="432.36">Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them.</p>
    <p data-start="420.90" data-end="432.36">然後，準備好旅程後，他們都出發前往翡翠城；溫基人為他們送上了三聲歡呼和許多美好的祝福。</p>
